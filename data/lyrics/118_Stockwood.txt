sis-ter, thou wast mild and love-ly,

>>pleas-ant as the air of ev’ning,
When it flows a->>mong the trees,

Thou no more wilt join our num-ber,
Thou no more our songs shall know.

Dearest sis-ter, thou hast left us,
Here thy loss we >>deep-ly feel,
But ’tis God that has be->>reft us;
He can all our >>sor-rows heal.

Yet a->>gain we hope to meet thee,
When the day of life is fled,
Then in heav’n with joy to greet thee,
Where no >fare->>well tear is shed.
