Je-sus, grant us all a bless-ing;
Send it down, Lord, from a-bove.
May we all go home a-praising,
And re->>joic-ing in Thy love.

fare-well, breth-ren, fare-well, sis-ters,
Till we all shall meet a-gain.

Je-sus, >>par-don all our fol-ly,
Since to->>geth-er we have been.
Make us hum-ble, make us ho-ly,
Cleanse us all from evâ€™ry sin.
