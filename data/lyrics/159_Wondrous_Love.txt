What >>won-drous love is this!
Oh, my soul, oh my soul!
That caused the Lord of bliss
To bear the >>dread-ful curse
For my soul?

When I was >>sink-ing down,
>>sink-ing down, >>sink-ing down,
be->>neath God’s >>righ-teous frown
Christ laid a->>side His crown
For my soul.

To God and to the Lamb,
I will sing; I will sing;
Who is the great I Am,
While >>mil-lions join the theme,
I will sing.

And when from death I’m free
I’ll sing on; I’ll sing on;
I’ll sing and >>joy-ful be,
through->>out eter->>ni-ty
I’ll sing on.
