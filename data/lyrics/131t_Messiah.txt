He comes, He comes! to judge the world,
a->>loud th’arch-an-gel cries,
While >>thun-ders roll from pole to pole,
And >>light-ning cleave the skies;
Th’af-fright-ed >>na-tions hear the sound,
And >>up-ward lift their eyes;
The slumb’ring >>ten-ants of the ground
In >>liv-ing ar-my-es rise.

Thou >>aw-ful judge of quick and dead,
The >>watch-ful pow’r be-stow,
So shall I to my ways take heed,
To all I speak or do.
If now Thou standest at the door,
Oh let me feel Thee near;
And make my peace with God,
be->>fore I at Thy bar ap-pear.
