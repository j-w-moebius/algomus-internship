Broad is the road that leads to death
And >>thou-sands walk to->>geth-er there;
But >>wis-dom shows a >>nar-row path,
With here and there a trav-el-er.

“de-ny thy-self, and take thy cross,”
Is the re-deem-er’s great com-mand;
>>na-ture must count her gold but dross,
If she would gain this heav’nly land.

The >>fear-ful soul that tires and faints
And walks the ways of God no more,
Is but es->>teemed >>al->most a saint,
And makes his own de->>struc-tion sure.

Lord, let not all my hopes be vain,
cre->>ate my heart en->>tire-ly new,
Which >>hyp-o->crites could ne’er at-tain,
Which false apos-tates >>nev-er knew.
