Now shall my >>in-ward joys a-rise,
And burst >>in-to a song;
al->>mighty love >in->>spires my heart,
And >>plea-sure tunes my tongue.

God, on His >>thirst-y Zi-on’s hill,
Some >>mer-cy drops has thrown;
And >>sol-emn oaths have bound His love
To show’r sal->>va-tion down.

Why do we then >in->>dulge our fears,
sus->>pi-cions and com-plaints?
Is He a God, and shall His grace
Grow >>wea-ry of His saints?
