How >>te-dious and >>taste-less the hours
When >>Je-sus no >>long-er I see!
Sweet pros-pects, sweet birds and sweet flow’rs
Have lost all their >>sweet-ness to me;
The >>mid->>sum-mer sun shines but dim,
The fields strive in vain to look gay;
But when I am >>hap-py in Him,
De-cem-ber’s as >>pleas-ant as May.

His name yields the sweetest per-fume,
And sweeter than >>mu-sic His voice;
His >>pres-ence dis-perses my gloom,
And makes all with->>in me re-joice;
I should, were He >>al->ways thus nigh,
Have >>noth-ing to wish or to fear;
No >>mor-tal as >>hap-py as I,
My >>sum-mer would last all the year.

>>con-tent with be->>hold-ing His face,
My all to His >>plea-sures re-signed,
No changes of >>sea-son or place
Would make any change in my mind;
While bless’d with a sense of His love;
A >>pal-ace a toy would ap-pear,
And >>pris-ons would >>pal-aces prove,
If >>Je-sus would dwell with me there.

Dear Lord, if >in->>deed I am Thine,
If Thou art my sun and my song,
Say, why do I >>lan-guish and pine,
And why are my >>win-ters so long?
Oh, drive these dark clouds from my sky,
Thy soul-cheering >>pres-ence re-store,
Or take me to Thee up on high,
Where >>win-ter and clouds are no more.
