Go, preach-ers, and tell it to the world,
Poor mourners found a home at last.

cho-rus:

Through free grace and a >>dy-ing Lamb,
Poor mourners found a home at last.

Go, fa-thers, and tell it to the world,
Poor mourners found a home at last.

(cho-rus)

Go, moth-ers, and tell it to the world,
Poor mourners found a home at last.
