Come, and taste, a->>long with me,
The >>wea-ry pil-grim’s con-so-la-tion;
>>bound-less mer-cy, >>run-ning free,
The >>ear-nest of com->>plete sal-va-tion;
Joy and peace in Christ I find,
My heart to Him is all re-signed.
The >>full-ness of His pow’r I prove,
The >>sweet-ness of re->>deem-ing love!
>>Je-sus is the pil-grim’s por-tion,
Love as >>bound-less as the o-cean.

When the world and flesh would rise,
And strive to draw me from my sav-ior,
>>strang-ers slight, or friends de-spise,
I then more >>high-ly prize His fa-vor,
Friends be->>lieve me when I tell,
If Christ be >>pres-ent all is well.
The world and flesh in vain may rise;
I all their >>ef-forts do de-spise;
In the world I’ve trib-u-la-tion,
But in Christ sweet con-so-la-tion.
