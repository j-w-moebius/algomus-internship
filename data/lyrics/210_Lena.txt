See the Lord of >>glo-ry dy-ing!
See Him gasping! Hear Him cry-ing!
See His >>bur-dened >>bos-om heave!
Look ye sin-ners, ye that hung Him,
Look how deep your sins have stung Him!
>>dy-ing sin-ners, look and live.

Bear with pa-tience, trib-u-la-tion,
over-come-ng all temp-ta-tion,
Till the >>glo-ri-ous ju-bi-lee;
Soon he’ll come with bursts of thun-der,
Then we shall a->>dore and won-der,
>>sing-ing on the highest key.

See the >>bliss-ful scenes be->>fore us,
Join the >uni-ver->>sal cho-rus,
Bid the >>flow-ing >>Num-bers rise;
Songs >im->>mor-tal >>sweet-ly sound-ing,
Notes >an->>gel-ic loud re-bound-ing,
trem-ble-ng ’round the >>vo-cal skies.
