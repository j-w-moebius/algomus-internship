Hail the day so long ex-pect-ed,
Hail the year of full re-lease.
Zi-on’s walls are now erected,
And her >>watch-man >>pub-lish peace.
Through our Shi-loh’s wide do-min-ion,
Hear the >>trum-pet >>loud-ly roar,
>>Bab-y->lon is >>fall-en to rise no more.

All her >>mer-chants stand with won-der,
What is this that comes to pass:
Murm’ring like the >>dis-tant thun-der,
cry-ing, “Oh a-las, a-las.”
Swell the sound, ye kings and no-bles,
Priest and peo-ple, rich and poor;
>>Bab-y->lon is >>fall-en to rise no more.

Blow the >>trum-pet in Mount Zi-on,
Christ shall come a >>sec-ond time;
>>rul-ing with a rod of >>i-ron
All who now as foes com-bine.
Ba-bel’s >>gar-ments we’ve re-ject-ed,
And our >>fel-low->ship is o’er,
>>Bab-y->lon is >>fall-en to rise no more.
