Oh, could I speak the match-less worth,
Oh, could I sound the glo-ry-es forth,
Which in my >>sav-ior shine.
I’d soar and touch the heav’nly strings,
And vie with >>Ga-bri-el while he sings,
In notes >>al->most di-vine.

Well, the de->>light-ful day will come,
When my dear Lord will take me home,
And I shall see His face.
Then with my sav-ior, broth-er, Friend,
A blest eter->>ni-ty I’ll spend,
tri->>um-phant in His grace.
