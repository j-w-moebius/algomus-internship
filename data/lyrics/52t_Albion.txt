Come, ye that love the Lord,
And let your joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet ac-cord,
While ye sur->>round His throne.

Let those re->>fuse to sing
Who >>nev-er knew our God;
But >>ser-vants of the heavâ€™nly King
May speak their joys a-broad.

The men of grace have found
>>glo-ry be->>gin be-low;
ce->>les-tial fruit on >>earth-ly ground
From faith and hope may grow.
