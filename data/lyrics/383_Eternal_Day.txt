Oh what of all my suff’rings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that en->>rap-tured host t’ap-pear
And >>wor-ship at Thy feet?
Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,
Take life or friends a-way,
But let me find them all a->>gain
In that eter->>nal day.

Oh what hath >>Je-sus bought for me,
be->>fore my rav-ish-ed eyes?
>>Riv-ers of life di->>vine I see,
And trees of par-a-dise.
I see a world of >>spir-its bright,
Who taste the >>plea-sures there,
They all are robed in >>spot-less white,
And conqu’ring palms they bear.
