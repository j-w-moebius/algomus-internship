The >>scat-ter-ed clouds are fled at last,
The rain is gone, the win-ter’s past;
The >>love-ly >>ver-nal flow’rs ap-pear,
The war-ble-ng choirs en->>chant our ear.
Now, with >>sweet-ly >>pen-sive moan,
Coos the >>tur-tle dove a-lone.

The voice of my be->>loved sounds,
While o’er the >>moun-tain top he bounds;
He flies ex->>ult-ing o’er the hills,
And all my soul with trans->>port fills.
>>gen-tle doth he chide my stay.
Rise, my soul, and come a-way.
