The God we >>wor-ship now,
Will guide us till we die,
Will be our God while here be-low,
And ours a->>bove the sky.

How >>de-cent and how wise!
How >>glo-ri-ous to be-hold,
be->>yond the pomp that charms the eye,
And rites adorned with gold.

Far as Thy name is known,
The world de->>clares Thy praise;
Thy saints, Oh Lord, be->>fore Thy throne
Their songs of >>hon-or raise.
