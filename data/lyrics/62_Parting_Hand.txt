My >>Chris-tian friends, in bonds of love,
Whose hearts in sweetest >>un-ion join,
Your friend-ship’s like a >>draw-ing band,
Yet we must take the >>part-ing hand.
Your com-pa-ny’s sweet, your >>un-ion dear,
Your words de->>light-ful to my ear;
Yet when I see that we must part
You draw like cords a->>round my heart.

How sweet the hours have passed a->>way
Since we have met to sing and pray;
How loath we are to leave the place
Where >>Je-sus shows His smiling face.
Oh could I stay with friends so kind,
How would it cheer my drooping mind!
But >>du-ty makes me >un-der->>stand
That we must take the >>part-ing hand.

And since it is God’s >>ho-ly will,
We must be >>part-ed for a while,
In sweet sub-mis-sion, all as one,
We’ll say, our fa-ther’s will be done.
My >>youth-ful friends, in >>Chris-tian ties,
Who seek for >>man-sions in the skies,
Fight on, we’ll gain that >>hap-py shore,
Where >>part-ing will be known no more.

How oft I’ve seen your >>flow-ing tears,
And heard you tell your hopes and fears!
Your hearts with love were seen to flame,
Which makes me hope we’ll meet a-gain.
Ye >>mourn-ing souls, lift up your eyes
To >>glo-ri-ous >>man-sions in the skies;
Oh trust His grace — in Ca-naan’s land
We’ll no more take the >>part-ing hand.

And now, my friends, both old and young,
I hope in Christ you’ll still go on;
And if on earth we meet no more,
Oh may we meet on Ca-naan’s shore.
I hope you’ll all re->>mem-ber me
If on earth no more I see;
An int’rest in your >>pray-ers I crave,
That we meet be->>yond the gra-ve.

Oh >>glo-ri-ous day! Oh >>bless-ed hope!
My soul leaps >>for-ward at the thought
When, on that hap-py, >>hap-py land,
We’ll no more take the >>part-ing hand.
But with our >>bless-ed >>ho-ly Lord
We’ll shout and sing with one ac-cord,
And there we’ll all with >>Je-sus dwell,
So, >>lov-ing Chris-tians, fare you well.
