My dear re-deem-er and my Lord,
I read my >>du-ty in Thy Word;
But in Thy life the law ap-pears,
Drawn out in >>liv-ing char-ac-ters.

Such was Thy truth and such Thy zeal,
Such def’rence to Thy fa-ther’s will;
Such love and meek-ness so di-vine,
I would tran->>scribe and make them mine.

Cold >>moun-tains and the >>mid->night air
>>wit-ness-ed the >>fer-vor of Thy pray-er;
The >>des-ert Thy temp->>ta-tions knew,
Thy >>con-flict and Thy vict’ry, too.

Be Thou my pat-tern; make me bear
More of Thy >>gra-cious >>im-age here;
Then God, the Judge, shall own my name,
a->>mong the foll’wers of the Lamb.
