Oh may our >>hum-ble >>spir-its stand
a->>mong them clothed in white.
The lowest place at His right hand
Is >>in-fi-nite de-light.
How will our joy and >>won-der rise,
When our re->>turn-ing King
Shall bear us >>home-ward through the skies
On love’s tri->>um-phant wing.

be-hold, what heav’nly >>Proph-ets sang
Is now at last ful-filled,
That death should yield his >>an-cient reign
And >>van-quish quite the field.
Let faith ex->>alt her >>joy-ful voice,
And thus be->>gin to sing,
Oh gra-ve, where is thy >>tri-umph now,
And where, Oh death, thy sting?
