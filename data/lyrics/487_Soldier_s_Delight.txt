While in the >>ar-my I re-main,
I’ll speak the truth and bear the blame,
And when on board the ship I am,
I’ll sing my sav-ior’s praise the same.

Oh, if your >>cap-tain calls for you,
Put on your >>ar-mor bold and true,
Put forth your strength, put forth your rod,
Fight for your >>coun-try and your God.
