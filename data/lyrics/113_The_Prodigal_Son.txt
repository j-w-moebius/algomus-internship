af-flic-tions, tho’ they seem se-vere,
Are oft in >>mer-cy sent:
They stopped the prod-i-gal’s ca-reer,
And caused him to re-pent.

cho-rus:

Oh, I die with hun-ger, here he cries,
And starve in a >>for-eign land,
My fa-ther’s house hath large sup-ply-es,
And boun-te-ous are his hands.

>al->>though he no re->>lent-ing felt
Till he had spent his store,
His >>stub-born heart be->>gin to melt
When >>fam-ine pinched him sore.

(cho-rus)

What have I gained by sin, he said,
But hun-ger, shame and fear?
My fa-ther’s house abounds with bread,
Whilst I am starving here.

(cho-rus)

I’ll go and tell him what I’ve done,
Fall down be->>fore his face;
Not >>wor-thy to be called his son,
I’ll ask a ser-vant’s place.

(cho-rus)

He saw his son re->>turn-ing back,
He looked, he ran, he smiled,
And threw his arms a->>round the neck
Of his rebell’ous child.
