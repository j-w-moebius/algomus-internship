fare-well, dear broth-ers, fare you well,
Pray do not weep for me,
I’m >>go-ing home to Christ to dwell
through->>out eter-ni-ty.
When I get home to that bright world,
And meet my >>sav-ior there,
And all the loved ones gone be-fore,
I’ll no more shed a tear.

Dear sis-ter, thou art left a-lone,
But thou art kind and true,
And when God calls you to come home,
I hope to meet you, too.
Thus we’ll sur->>round the great white throne,
And dwell for->>ev-er there,
And sing God’s praise through >>end-less days,
From sor-row, pain and care.

Dear fa-ther, you’ve been kind to me,
When I was young and wild,
But now, dear fa-ther, do not weep,
for->>give your >>lov-ing child.
O may we all to->>geth-er meet,
And shout, and praise and sing
>hal-le->>lu-jah then to our God,
Our >>sav-ior and our King.

My >>lov-ing moth-er, fare you well,
But do not fear a-larm,
The >>sav-ior dear is >>ev-er near,
To shield you from all harm.
Yet may we meet and be com-plete,
With all the blood-washed throng,
And cast our crown at Je-sus’ feet,
And sing re-demp-tion’s song.
