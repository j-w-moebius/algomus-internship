How bright is the day when the >>Chris-tian
re->>ceives the sweet >>mes-sage to come,
To rise to the >>man-sions of glo-ry,
And be there for->>ev-er at home.

The >>an-gels stand >>read-y and wait-ing,
The >>mo-ment the >>spir-it is gone,
To >>car-ry it >>up-ward to heav-en,
And >>wel-come it >>safe-ly home.

The saints that have gone up be->>fore us,
All raise a new shout as we come,
And sing >hal-le->>lu-jah the louder
To >>wel-come the >>trav-el-ers home.
