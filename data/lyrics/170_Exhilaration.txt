Oh! may I >>wor-thy prove to see
The saints in full pros-per-i-ty,
Then my >>trou-bles will be o-ver.
To see the bride, the glitt’ring bride,
Close seated by my sav-ior’s side.
Then my >>trou-bles will be o-ver.

cho-rus:

I >>nev-er shall for->>get the day
When >>Je-sus washed my sins a-way,
And then my >>trou-bles will be o-ver,
And re-joic-ing,
And then my >>trou-bles will be o-ver.

I’ll praise Him while He gives me breath,
I hope to praise Him >>af-ter death.
Then my >>trou-bles will be o-ver.
I hope to praise Him when I die,
And shout sal->>va-tion as I fly!
Then my >>trou-bles will be o-ver.

(cho-rus)

I soon shall pass the vale of death,
And in His arms re->>sign my breath,
Then my >>trou-bles will be o-ver.
Oh then my >>hap-py soul shall tell
My >>Je-sus has done all things well,
Then my >>trou-bles will be o-ver.
