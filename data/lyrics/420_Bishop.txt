Our fa-ther’s gone to that bright land,
He dwells with Christ, the King;
And with the saints of old doth stand,
While all the >>an-gels sing.

a->>round dear moth-er’s bed we stood
And watched her >>dy-ing face;
While >>Je-sus bade her >>spir-it come
And take a heav’nly place.

Their forms on earth no more we see,
They’re >>hid-den from our view;
Their mem’ries >>lin-ger still with me,
As no-ble, good and true.

Could we but stand and view that goal,
’Twould dry our brin-y tears;
True love and joy there to be-hold,
Would >>ban-ish all our fears.
