My friends, I am >>go-ing a long and >>te-dious jour-ney,
>>nev-er to re-turn. Fare you well my friends,
And God grant we may meet to->>geth-er in that world a-bove,
Where >>trou-ble shall cease and >>har-mo-ny shall a-bound.

Hark! Hark! my dear friends, for death hath called me,
And I must go, and lie down in the cold and >>si-lent gra-ve,
Where the mourners cease from >>mourn-ing and the prisâ€™ner is set free:
Where the rich and the poor are both a-like.
Fare you well, my friends.
