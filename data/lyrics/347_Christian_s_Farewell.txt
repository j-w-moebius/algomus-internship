breth-ren, fare-well, I do you tell,
I’m >>sor-ry to leave, I love you so well.
Now I must go, where I don’t know,
wher->>ev-er Christ leads me the >>trum-pet to blow.

Here I have worked, >>la-bored a-while,
But >>la-bor is sweet if >>Je-sus doth smile.
When I am done, I will go home
Where >>Je-sus is smiling and bids me to come.
