My >>shep-herd is the Lord most high,
And all my wants He will sup-ply,
In >>pas-tures green he makes me lie,
And leads by streams that >>nev-er die.

He in His >>mer-cy doth re-store,
My soul when >>sink-ing in dis-tress,
For His name’s >>sa-ke He >>ev-er->more
Leads me in paths of righ-teous-ness.

Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale,
E’en there no evil shall I fear,
be->>cause Thy >>pres-ence shall not fail.
Thy rod and staff my soul shall cheer;

For me a >>ta-ble Thou hast spread
be->>fore the faces of my foes;
With oil Thou dost a->>noint my head,
My cup is full and over-flows.
