The Lord will >>hap-pi-ness di->>vine
On con->>trite hearts be-stow;
Then tell me >>gra-cious God is mine,
A con->>trite heart, or no?

I hear, but seem to hear in vain,
>in->>sen-si-ble as steel;
If aught is felt, ’tis >>on-ly pain
To find I >>can-not feel.

I some->>times think >my->>self >in->>clined
To love Thee, if I could;
But >>of-ten feel an->>oth-er mind
a->>verse to all that’s good.

My best de->>sires are faint and few,
I fain would strive for more;
But, when I cry, “My strength re-new,”
Seem weaker than be-fore.

Thy saints are com-fort-ed, I know,
And love Thy house of pray-er;
I some->>times go where >>oth-ers go,
But find no >>com-fort there.
