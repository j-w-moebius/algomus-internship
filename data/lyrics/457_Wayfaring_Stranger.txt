I am a poor, way-far-erg strang-er,
While journ’ying through this world of woe,
Yet, there’s no sick-ness, toil nor dan-ger,
In that bright land to which I go.
I’m >>go-ing there to see my fa-ther,
I’m >>go-ing there no more to roam;

cho-rus:
I’m >>on-ly >>go-ing >>o-ver Jor-dan,
I’m >>on-ly >>go-ing >>o-ver home.

I know dark clouds will >>gath-er o’er me,
I know my way is rough and steep;
Yet beaut’ous fields lie just be->>fore me,
Where God’s re->>deem-ed their >>vig-ils keep.
I’m >>go-ing there to see my moth-er,
She said she’d meet me when I come.

(cho-rus)

I want to wear a crown of glo-ry,
When I get home to that good land;
I want to shout sal-va-tion’s sto-ry,
In >>con-cert with the blood-washed band.
I’m >>go-ing there to meet my sav-ior,
To sing His praise for-ev-er-more;

(cho-rus)
