Ye >>lit-tle flock whom >>Je-sus feeds,
dis->>miss your >>anx-ious fears;
Look to the >>shep-herd of your souls,
And smile a->>way your tears,
Though wolves and >>li-ons prowl a-round,
His staff is your de-fense,
’Mid sands and rocks your shep-herd’s voice,
Calls streams and >>pas-tures thence.

Your >>fa-ther will a >>king-dom give,
And give it with de-light.
His fee-ble-st child His love shall call,
To >>tri-umph in His sight.
A house of >>man-y >>man-sions where
His love will >>ban-ish grief,
To sit with joy at God’s own throne,
And know eter->>nal peace.
