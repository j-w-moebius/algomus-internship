On Jor-dan’s >>storm-y banks I stand,
And cast a >>wish-ful eye
To Ca-naan’s fair and >>hap-py land,
Where my pos->>ses-sions lie.

Don’t you feel like >>go-ing home,
My home it is in the >>prom-ised land,
And I feel like >>go-ing home.

O, the trans->>port-ing rapt’rous scene,
That rises to my sight!
Sweet fields ar->>ray-ed in >>liv-ing green,
And >>Riv-ers of de-light.

Yes, I feel like >>go-ing home,
My home it is in the >>prom-ised land,
And I feel like >>go-ing home.
