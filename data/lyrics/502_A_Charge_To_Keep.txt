A charge to keep I have,
A God to glo-ri-fy,
A nev-er-dy-ing soul to save,
And fit it for the sky.
To serve the >>pres-ent age,
My >>call-ing to ful-fill,
Oh may it all my powâ€™rs en->>gage
To do my mas-terâ€™s will.

Arm me with >>jeal-ous care,
As in Thy sight to live;
And Oh Thy ser-vant, Lord, pre-pare,
A strict ac->>count to give.
Help me watch and pray,
And on >thy->>self re-ly,
as-sured, if I my trust be-tray,
I shall for->>ev-er die.
