ho-san-na, to Je-sus, my soul’s filled with praises,
Come, Oh my dear breth-ren, and help me to sing;
No >>mu-sic so charm-ing, no look is so warm-ing,
It gives life and >>com-fort and glad-ness with-in.
ho-san-na is ring-ing: Oh how I love sing-ing,
There’s >>noth-ing so sweet as the sound of His name;
The >>an-gels in >>glo-ry re->>peat the glad >>sto-ry
Of love which in >>Je-sus is made known to man.

ho-san-na to Je-sus! my soul how it pleases
To see >>sin-ners >>fall-ing and >>cry-ing to God;
Then >>shout-ing and praising, they cry, “’Tis amaz-ing;
We’ve found peace and >>par-don in Je-sus’ blood.”
ho-san-na is ring-ing, hark, how they are sing-ing,
“All >>glo-ry to Je-sus, we’ve tasted His love!”
The >>king-dom of >>heav-en to >>mor-tals is giv-en,
And rolls through my soul from the >>man-sions a-bove.
