Come, let us join our friends a->>bove
That have ob->>tain-ed the prize;
And on the >>ea-gle wings of love
To joy ce->>les-tial rise.
Let all the saints terrest’ri-al sing
With those to >>glo-ry gone;
For all the >>ser-vants of our King
In heav’n and earth are one.

One fam-i-ly, we dwell in Him,
One church a-bove, be-neath.
Though now di->>vid-ed by the stream,
The >>nar-row stream of death.
One >>ar-my of the >>liv-ing God,
To His com->>mand we bow;
Part of the host have crossed the flood,
And part are >>cross-ing now.
