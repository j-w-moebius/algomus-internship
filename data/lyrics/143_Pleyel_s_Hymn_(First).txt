While Thee I seek, pro->>tect-ing Pow’r,
Be my vain wishes stilled,
And may this >>con-se->crat-ed hour
With >>bet-ter hopes be filled.
Thy love the pow’r of thought be-stow-ed,
To Thee my thoughts would soar;
Thy >>mer-cy o’er my life has flowed,
That >>mer-cy I a-dore.

In each e->>vent of life, how clear
Thy >>rul-ing hand I see!
Each >>bless-ing to my soul more dear,
be->>cause con->>fer-red by Thee.
In ev’ry joy that crowns my days,
In ev’ry pain I bear,
My heart shall find de->>light in praise,
Or seek re->>lief in pray-er.

When glad-ness wings my >>fa-vored hour,
Thy love my thoughts shall fill;
re->>signed when storms of >>sor-row low-er,
My soul shall meet Thy will.
My lifted eye, with->>out a tear,
The >>gath-er-ing storm shall see:
My >>stead->fast heart shall know no fear;
That heart shall rest on Thee.
