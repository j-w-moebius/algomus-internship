I be-hold, and lo a great mul-ti-tude,
Which no man could num-ber:
>>thou-sands of thou-sands, and ten times >>thou-sands
Stood be->>fore the Lamb,
And they had palms in their hands,

And they cease not day nor night, say-ing,
ho-ly, ho-ly, Lord God al-might-y,
Which was, and is, and is to come,

And I heard a >>might-y >>an-gel
>>fly-ing through the midst of heavâ€™n,
>>cry-ing with a loud voice:
Woe, woe, woe
Be >>un-to the earth by >>rea-son of the >>trum-pet
Which is yet to sound.

And when the last >>trum-pet sounded,

The great men and no-bles, rich men and poor,
Bond and free, >>gath-er-ed them->>selves to-geth-er,
And cried to the rocks and >>moun-tains
To fall up->>on them and hide them from
The face of Him that sitteth on the throne;
For the great day of the Lord is come,
And who shall be >>a-ble to stand?
