There is a >>hap-py land, far, far a-way,
Where saints in >>glo-ry stand, bright, bright as day.
Oh how they >>sweet-ly sing,
>>wor-thy is our sav-ior, King,
Loud let His praises ring,
Praise, praise for aye.

Come to that >>hap-py land, come, come a-way,
Why will ye >>doubt-ing stand, why yet de-lay?
Oh we shall >>hap-py be
When from sin and >>sor-row free,
Lord, we shall live with Thee,
Blest, blest for aye.

Bright in that >>hap-py land beams ev’ry eye,
Kept by a fa-ther’s hand, love >>can-not die;
Then shall His >>king-dom come,
Saints shall share a >>glo-ri-ous home,
And bright a->>bove the sun
We’ll reign for aye.
