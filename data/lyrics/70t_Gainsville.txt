Lord, we come be->>fore Thee now,
At Thy feet we >>hum-ble bow;
Oh do not our suit dis-dain;
Shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain?

Lord, on Thee our souls de-pend;
In com->>pas-sion new de-scend;
Fill our hearts with Thy rich grace,
Tune our lips to sing Thy praise.

In Thine own ap->>point-ed way
Now we seek Thee, here we stay;
Lord, we know not how to go,
Till a >>bless-ing Thou be-stow.

Send some >>mes-sage from Thy word
That may joy and peace af-ford;
Let Thy >>spir-it now >im->>part
Full sal->>va-tion to each heart.

>>com-fort those who weep and mourn;
Let the time of joy re-turn;
Those who are cast down lift up,
Strong in faith, in love and hope.

Grant that all may seek and find
Thee a God su->>preme-ly kind;
Heal the sick, the >>cap-tive free,
Let us all re->>joice in Thee.
