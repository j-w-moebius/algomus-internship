See how the >>wick-ed >>king-dom
Is >>fall-ing ev’ry day!
And still our >>bless-ed >>Je-sus
Is >>win-ning souls a-way:
But oh, how I am tempted,
No >>mor-tal tongue can tell!
So >>of-ten I’m sur->>round-ed
With en-e-my-es from hell.

With >>weep-ing and with pray-ing,
My >>Je-sus I have found,
To >>cru-ci->fy old na-ture,
And make His grace a-bound.
Dear chil-dren, don’t be wea-ry,
But march on in the way;
For >>Je-sus will stand by you,
And be your guard and stay.

If >>sin-ners will serve Sa-tan,
And join with one ac-cord,
Dear breth-ren, as for my part,
I’m bound to serve the Lord;
And if you will go with me,
Pray, give to me your hand,
And we’ll march on to-geth-er,
>>un-to the >>prom-ised land.
