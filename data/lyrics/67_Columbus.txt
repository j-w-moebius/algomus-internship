Oh, once I had a >>glo-ri-ous view
Of my re->>deem-ing Lord,
He said, “I’ll be a God to you,”
And I be->>lieved His word.
But now I have a deeper stroke
Than all my groanings are;
My God has me of late for-sake;
He’s gone, I know not where.

Oh, what >im->>mor-tal joys I felt,
On that ce->>les-tial day,
When my hard heart be->>gin to melt,
By love dis->>solved a-way!
By my com->>plaint is >>bit-ter now,
For all my joys are gone;
I’ve strayed! I’m left! I know not how;
The light’s from me with-drawn.

Once I could joy the saints to meet,
To me they were most dear;
I then could stoop to wash their feet,
And shed a >>joy-ful tear;
But now I meet them as the rest,
And with them joy-less stay;
My con-ver-sa-tion’s spir-it-less,
Or else I’ve nought to say.

I once could mourn o’er >>dy-ing men,
And longed their souls to win;
I tra-vail-ed for their poor chil-dren,
And warned them of their sin;
But now my heart’s so >>care-less grown,
>al->>though they’re drowned in vice,
My >>bow-els o’er them cease to yearn —
My tears have left mine eyes.

I >>for-ward go in du-ty’s way,
But can’t per->>ceive Him there;
Then >>back-ward on the road I stray,
But >>can-not find Him there;
On the left hand, where He doth work,
a->>mong the >>wick-ed crew,
And on the right I find Him not
a->>mong the >>fa-vored few.

What shall I do? Shall I lie down
And sink in deep de-spair?
Will He for->>ev-er frown,
Nor hear my >>fee-ble pray-er?
No; He will put His strength in me,
He knows the way I’ve strolled,
And when I’m tried suf->>fi-cient-ly
I shall come forth as gold.
