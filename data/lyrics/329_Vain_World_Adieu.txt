When for eter->>nal worlds we steer,

And >>dis-tant hills of >>Ca-naan rise,
The soul for joy then claps her wings,
And loud her >hal-le->>lu-jah sings,
Vain world, a-dieu.

With >>cheer-ful hope her eyes ex->>plore
Each >>land->mark on the >>dis-tant shore:
The trees of life, the >>pas-tures green,
The >>crys-tal stream, de->>light-ful scene.

And loud her >hal-le->>lu-jah sings,
Vain world, a-dieu.

The nearer still she draws to land,
More >>ea-ger all her pow’rs ex-pand;
With >>stead-y helm, and freebent sail,
Her >>an-chor drops with->>in the veil.

And her ce->>les-tial >>son-net sings,
I’m there at last.
