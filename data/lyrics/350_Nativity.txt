Oh for a >>thou-sand tongues to sing
My great re-deem-er’s praise,
The glo-ry-es of my God and king,
The >>tri-umphs of His grace.

He breaks the pow’r of >>can-cel-ed sin,
He sets the pris’ner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.

My >>gra-cious >>mas-ter and my God,
as->>sist me to pro-claim,
To spread through all the earth a->>broad
The >>hon-ors of Thy name.
