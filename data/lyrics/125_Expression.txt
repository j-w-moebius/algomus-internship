Oh, Je-sus, my sav-ior, I know Thou art mine;
For Thee all the >>plea-sures of earth I re-sign.
Of >>ob-jects most pleas-ing, I love Thee the best;
with->>out Thee Iâ€™m wretch-ed, but with Thee Iâ€™m bless-ed.

Thou art my rich trea-sure, my joy and my love,
None richer pos->>sessed by the >>an-gels a-bove;
For Thee all the >>plea-sures of sense I fore-go,
And >>wan-der a pil-grim, de->>spised be-low.

Thy >>spir-it taught me to know I was blind,
And taught me the way of sal->>va-tion to find.
For when I was >>sink-ing in >>dread-ful de-spair,
My >>Je-sus re->>lieved me and bid me not fear.
