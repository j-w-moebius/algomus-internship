Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
Thy >>bet-ter >>por-tion trace,
Rise from >>tran-si->to-ry things,
To heav’n, thy >>na-tive place.
Sun, and moon, and stars de-cay,
Time shall soon this earth re-move,
Rise, my soul, and haste a-way,
To seats pre->>pared a-bove.

Cease, ye pil-grims, cease to mourn,
Press >>on-ward to the prize;
Soon our >>sav-ior will re-turn,
tri->>um-phant in the skies.
Yet a sea-son, and you know,
>>hap-py >>en-trance will be giv’n,
All our >>sor-rows left be-low,
And earth ex->>changed for heav’n.
