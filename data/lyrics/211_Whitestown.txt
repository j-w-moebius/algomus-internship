Where >>noth-ing dwelt but beasts of prey,
Or men as fierce and wild as they,
He bids thâ€™op-pressed and poor re-pair,
And build them towns and cities there.

They sow the fields, and trees they plant,
Whose >>year-ly fruit sup-ply-es their want;
Their race grows up from >>fruit-ful stocks,
Their wealth in->>creases with their flocks.
