Lord, what a >>thought-less wretch was I,
To mourn, and mur-mur, and re-pine,
To see the >>wick-ed placed on high,
In pride and robes of >>hon-or shine.

But, oh, their end, their >>dread-ful end,
Thy >>sanc-tu->ary taught me so,
On slippâ€™ry rocks I see them stand,
And >>fi-ery >>bil-lows roll be-low.
