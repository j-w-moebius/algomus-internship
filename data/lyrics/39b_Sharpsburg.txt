Blest >>Je-sus while in >>mor-tal flesh
I hold my frail a->>bode
Still would my >>spir-it rest on Thee,
My >>sav-ior and my God.

On Thy dear cross I fix my eyes,
My trust on Thee com-plete,
Till love dis->>solves my in-most soul
At my re-deem-er’s feet.

Be dead my heart, to >>world-ly charms,
Be dead to ev’ry sin;
And tell the boldest foe with->>out
That >>Je-sus reigns with-in.
