Lay up nearer, broth-er, nearer,
For my limbs are >>grow-ing cold;
And thy >>pres-ence seemeth nearer,
When thine arms a->>round me fold.

I am dy-ing, broth-er, dy-ing,
Soon you’ll miss me in your berth
For my form will soon be >>ly-ing
’Neath the o-cean’s brin-y surf.

I am go-ing, broth-er, go-ing,
But my hope in God is strong;
I am will-ing, broth-er, know-ing,
That He do-eth >>noth-ing wrong.

Hark! I hear the >>sav-ior speak-ing,
’Tis, I know, His voice so well;
When I’m gone, Oh don’t be weep-ing,
broth-er, hear my last fare-well.


In >>mem-o-ry of: Paul >>Lu-ther Wil-son, ✝ twen-ty-two-03-2019
