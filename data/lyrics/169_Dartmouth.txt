Come, sound His praise a-broad,
And hymns of >>glo-ry sing,
Je->>ho-vah is the sov’reign God,
The >uni-ver->>sal King.
He formed the deeps un-known,
He gave the seas their bound,
The wat’ry worlds are all His own,
And all the >>sol-id ground.

Come, >>wor-ship at His throne,
Come, bow be->>fore the Lord;
We are His work, and not our own:
He formed us by His Word.
to->>day at->>tend His voice,
Nor dare pro->>voke His rod;
Come, like the >>peo-ple of His choice,
And your own >>gra-cious God.
