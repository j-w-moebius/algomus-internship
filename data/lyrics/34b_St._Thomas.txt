Come, sound His praise a-broad,
And hymns of >>glo-ry sing;
Je->>ho-vah is the sov’reign God,
The >uni-ver->>sal King.

He formed the deeps un-known;
He gave the seas their bound;
The wat’ry worlds are all His own,
And all the >>sol-id ground.

Come, >>wor-ship at His throne,
Come bow be->>fore the Lord;
We are His works, and not our own,
He formed us by His word.
