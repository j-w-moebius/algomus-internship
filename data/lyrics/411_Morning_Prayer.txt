Come, let us raise our voices high,
And form a >>sa-cred song,
To Him who rules the earth and sky,
And does our days pro-long.
Who through the night gave us to rest,
This >>morn-ing cheered our eyes;
And with the >>thou-sands of the blest,
In health made us to rise.

>>ear-ly to God weâ€™ll send our pray-er,
Make haste to pray and praise,
That He may make our good His care,
And guide us all our days.
And when the night of death comes on,
And we shall end our days;
May His rich grace the theme pro->>long
Of His eter->>nal praise.
