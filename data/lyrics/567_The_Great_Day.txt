I’ve a long time heard that there will be a judg-ment,
That there will be a >>judg-ment in that day.
Oh, sin-ner, where will you stand in that day?

I’ve a long time heard that the sun will be dark-en-ed,
That the sun will be >>dark-en-ed in that day.
Oh, sin-ner, where will you stand in that day?

I’ve a long time heard that the earth will be burn-ing,
That the earth will be >>burn-ing in that day.
Oh, sin-ner, where will you stand in that day?
