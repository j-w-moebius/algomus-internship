Come, all my dear breth-ren, and help me to sing;
I’m >>go-ing to Je-sus, He’s heav-en’s great King.
He died to a->>tone for the sins of the world;
His >>ban-ner is fly-ing, His sails are un-furl-ed.

cho-rus:
Heav’n’s my home,
I’m >>go-ing to Je-sus, for heav-en’s my home.

While here in the >>val-ley of >>con-flict I stay,
Oh, give me sub-mis-sion, and strength as my day,
In all my af->>flic-tions to Thee would I come,
re->>joic-ing in hope of my >>glo-ri-ous home.

(cho-rus)

I long, dearest Lord, in Thy beau-ty-es to shine,
No more as an >>ex->ile in >>sor-row to pine;
And in Thy dear >>im-age a->>rise from the tomb,
With glo-ri-fy-ed >>mil-lions to praise Thee at home.

(cho-rus)
