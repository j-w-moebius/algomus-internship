Dear friends, fare-well! I do you tell,
Since you and I must part;
I go a-way, and here you stay,
But still we’re joined at heart.
Your love to me has been most free,
Your >con-ver->>sa-tion sweet;
How can I bear to >>jour-ney where
With you I >>can-not meet?

I trust you’ll pray both night and day,
And keep your >>gar-ments white;
For you and me that we may be
The >>chil-dren of the Light.
If you die first, >a->>non you must,
The will of God be done;
I hope the Lord will you re->>ward
With an >im->>mor-tal crown.
