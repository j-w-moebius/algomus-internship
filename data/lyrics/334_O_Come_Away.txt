O come, come a-way,
From >>la-bor now re-pose-ng,
Our >>ju-bi->lee has set us free —
O come, come a-way!
Come, hail the day that >>cel-e->brates
The >>ran-som of th’in-ebri-ates
From all that does in-tox-i-cate,
O come, come a-way!

We >>wel-come you here!
With heart and hand wide o-pen,
Ye >>gal-lant sons of >>tem-per-ance —
We >>wel-come you here!
Heav’n’s >>bless-ings on your plans, we pray!
Ye come our >>sink-ing friends to save,
And >>res-cue from a drunk-ard’s gra-ve;
We >>wel-come you here!

We >>wel-come you here!
Ye who with taste per->>vert-ed
Have seized the cup, and drank it up —
We >>wel-come you here!
Come, join us in our >>ho-ly aim,
The poor be->>sot-ted to re-claim,
The >>bro-ken heart to cheer a-gain,
O come, sign the pledge!
