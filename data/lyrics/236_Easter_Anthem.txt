The Lord is ris’n in-deed! hal-le-lu-jah!

Now is Christ >>ris-en from the dead,
And be->>come the first-fruits of them that slept.

hal-le-lu-jah, and did He rise? did He rise?

Hear it ye na-tions! hear it, Oh ye dead!

He ro-sé, He burst the bars of death
And >>tri-umph-ed o’er the gra-ve.

Then I ro-sé, then first hu->>man-i-ty
tri->>um-phant passed the >>crys-tal ports of light
And seized eter->>nal youth.

Man, all >im->>mor-tal hail,
Hail heav-en, all >>lav-ish of strange gifts to man,
Thine’s all the glo-ry,
Man’s the >>bound-less bliss.
