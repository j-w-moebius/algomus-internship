While >>shep-herds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The >>an-gel of the Lord came down,
And >>glo-ry shone a-round.
On this day is born to you
A >>sav-ior meek and mild;
Haste ye all to >>Beth-le->hem
And kneel be->>fore the Child.

Lay down your crooks and quit your flocks,
To >>Beth-le->hem re-pair;
And let your wandâ€™ring steps be spared,
By >>yon-der >>shin-ing star.
Seek ye not in pal-aces,
Nor >>re-gal >>cur-tains draw.
Search the sta-ble, see your God
ex->>tend-ed on the straw.
