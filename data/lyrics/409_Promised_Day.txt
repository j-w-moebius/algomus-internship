How long, dear sav-ior, Oh how long
Shall this bright hour de-lay?
Fly swift a-round, ye wheels of time,
And bring the >>prom-ised day.

The God of >>glo-ry down to men
re->>moves His blest a-bode;
Men, the dear >>ob-ject of His grace,
And He the >>liv-ing God.

His own soft hand shall wipe the tears
From evâ€™ry >>weep-ing eye,
And pains and groans and griefs and fears
And death >it->>self shall die.
