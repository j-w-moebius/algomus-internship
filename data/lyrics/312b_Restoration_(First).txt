Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry bless-ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace.
Streams of mer-cy, >>nev-er ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

cho-rus:

I will rise and go to Je-sus,
He’ll em->>brace me in His arms;
In the arms of my dear sav-ior;
Oh there are ten >>thou-sand charms.

Teach me some me->>lo-di-ous son-net,
Sung by >>flam-ing tongues a-bove;
Praise the mount — O fix me on it —
Mount of Thy re->>deem-ing love!
