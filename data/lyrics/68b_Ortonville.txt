How sweet the name of >>Je-sus sounds
In a be-liever’s ear!
It soothes his sor-rows, heals his wounds,
And drives a->>way his fears.

It makes the >>wound-ed >>spir-it whole,
And calms the >>trou-bled breast;
’Tis >>man-na to the >>hun-gry soul,
And to the >>wea-ry rest.

Dear name! the rock on which I build,
My shield and >>hid-ing place;
My nev-er-fail-ing >>trea-sury filled
With >>bound-less stores of grace.
