be-hold, the Judge de-scends, His guards are nigh;
tem-pests and fire at->>tend Him down the sky;
Heav’n, earth and hell draw near, let all things come
To hear His >>jus-tice and the sin-ner’s doom;

But >>gath-er first, my saints, the Judge com-mands,
Bring them, ye an-gels, from their >>dis-tant lands.
