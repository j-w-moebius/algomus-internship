Come, >>lit-tle chil-dren, now we may
par->>take a >>lit-tle mor-sel.
For >>lit-tle songs and >>lit-tle ways
Adorned a great apos-tle.
A >>lit-tle drop of Je-sus’ blood
Can make a feast of un-ion;
It is by >>lit-tle steps we move
>>in-to a full com-mu-nion.

A >>lit-tle faith doth >>might-y deeds,
Quite past all my re-count-ing;
Faith like a >>lit-tle >>mus-tard seed
Can move a >>loft-y moun-tain.
A >>lit-tle >>char-i-ty and zeal,
A >>lit-tle trib-u-la-tion,
A >>lit-tle >>pa-tience makes us feel
Great peace and con-so-la-tion.

A >>lit-tle cross with cheer-ful-ness,
A >>lit-tle self-de-ni-al,
Will serve to make our >>trou-bles less,
And bear the greatest tri-al,
The >>spir-it like a >>lit-tle dove
On >>Je-sus once de-scend-ed;
To show His meek-ness and His love,
The >>em-blem was in-tend-ed.

The >>ti-tle of the >>lit-tle Lamb
>>un-to our Lord was giv-en,
Such was our sav-ior’s >>lit-tle name,
The Lord of earth and heav-en.
A >>lit-tle voice that’s small and still
Can rule the whole cre-a-tion;
A >>lit-tle stone the earth shall fill,
And >>hum-ble ev’ry na-tion.
