Oh, how >>charm-ing
Are the >>ra->di-ant bands of mu-sic!
>>fly-ing in the air.

The church tri->>um-phant gives the tone
While they sur->>round the >>ho-ly throne,
In glo-ry, with ce->>les-tial arts,
>an->>gel-ic ar-my-es tune their harps,
And rap-tured ser-aphs play their parts:
Strike their notes at our re-deem-erâ€™s birth.
