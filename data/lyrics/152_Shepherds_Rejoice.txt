shep-herds, re-joice! lift up your eyes,
And send your fears a-way,
News from the >>re-gions of the skies,
A sav-ior’s born to-day.
Je-sus, the God whom >>an-gels fear,
Comes down to dwell with you.
to->>day He makes His >>en-trance here,
But not as >>mon->archs do.

No gold nor >>pur-ple swad-dle-ng bands,
Nor >>roy-al >>shin-ing things,
A >>man-ger for His >>cra-dle stands,
And holds the King of kings.
Go, shep-herd, where the >>in-fant lies,
And see His >>hum-ble throne;
The tears of joy in all your eyes,
Go, shep-herd, kiss the Son.

Thus >>Ga-bri-el sang and straight a->>bound
The heav’nly ar-my-es throng,
They tune their harps to >>soft-ly sound,
And thus con->>clude their song.
>>glo-ry to God who reigns a-bove,
Let peace sur->>round the earth,
>>mor-tals shall know their mak-er’s love
At their re-deem-er’s birth.
