Am I a >>sol-dier of the cross,
A foll’wer of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

cho-rus:

Oh, the Lamb, the >>liv-ing Lamb,
The Lamb of cal-va-ry,
The Lamb that was slain, but lives a->>gain
To >in-ter->>cede for me.

Must I be car-ry-ed to the skies
On flow’ry beds of ease,
While >>oth-ers fought to win the prize
And sailed through >>blood-y seas?

(cho-rus)

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace
To help me on to God?

(cho-rus)
