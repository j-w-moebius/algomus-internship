breth-ren, we have met to wor-ship,
And a->>dore the Lord our God;
Will you pray with all your pow-er,
While we try to preach the Word?
All is vain un->>less the >>spir-it
Of the >>ho-ly One comes down;
breth-ren, pray and >>ho-ly >>man-na
Will be >>show-er-ed all a-round.

breth-ren, see poor >>sin-ners ’round you,
trem-ble-ng on the brink of woe;
Death is com-ing, hell is mov-ing,
Can you bear to let them go?
See our fa-thers, see our moth-ers,
And our >>chil-dren >>sink-ing down;
breth-ren, pray, and >>ho-ly >>man-na
Will be >>show-er-ed all a-round.

sis-ters, will you join and help us?
Mo-ses’ >>sis-ters aided him;
Will you help the trem-ble-ng mourners,
Who are strug-gle-ng hard with sin?
Tell them all a->>bout the sav-ior,
Tell them that He will be found;
sis-ters, pray, and >>ho-ly >>man-na
Will be >>show-er-ed all a-round.

Is there here a trem-ble-ng jail-er,
Seeking grace, and filled with tears?
Is there here a >>weep-ing Mar-y,
Pouring forth a flood of tears?
breth-ren, join your cries to help them;
sis-ters, let your >>pray-ers a-bound;
Pray, Oh pray that >>ho-ly >>man-na
May be >>scat-ter-ed all a-round.

Let us love our God su-preme-ly,
Let us love each oth-er, too;
Let us love and pray for sin-ners,
Till our God makes all things new.
Then He’ll call us home to heav-en,
At His >>ta-ble we’ll sit down;
Christ will gird him-self, and serve us
With sweet >>man-na all a-round.
