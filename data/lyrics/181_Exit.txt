Death, like an >>over-flow->ing stream,
Sweeps us a-way; our life’s a dream,
An >>emp-ty tale, a >>morn-ing flow’r,
Cut down and >>with-er-ed in an hour.

Our age to sev’nty years is set;
How short the time! How frail the state
And if to >>eight-y we ar-rive,
We’d >>rath-er sigh and groan than live.

(But oh how oft Thy wrath ap-pears,
And cuts off our ex->>pect-ed years,
Thy wrath awakes our >>hum-ble dread:
We fear the >>pow-er that strikes us dead.)
