All hail the pow’r of Je-sus’ name!
Let >>an-gels >>pros-trate fall,
Bring forth the >>roy-al di-a-dem,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Ye >>cho-sen seed of Is-ra-el’s race,
A >>rem-nant weak and small;
Hail Him who saves you by His grace;
And crown Him Lord of all.

Oh that with >>yon-der >>sa-cred throng,
We at His feet may fall!
We’ll join the >ev-er->>last-ing song,
And crown Him Lord of all.
