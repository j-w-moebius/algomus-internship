Ye >>fleet-ing charms of earth fare-well,
Your springs of joy are dry;
My soul now seeks an->>oth-er home.
A brighter world on high.

cho-rus:

I’m a long time trav’ling here be-low,
I’m a long time trav’ling a->>way from home,
I’m a long time trav’ling here be-low,
To lay this >>bod-y down.

fare-well, my friends, whose >>ten-der care
Has long en->>gaged my love;
Your fond em->>brace I now ex->>change
For >>bet-ter friends a-bove.
