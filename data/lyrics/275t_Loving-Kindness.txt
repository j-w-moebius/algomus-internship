a-wake, my soul, to >>joy-ful lays,
hal-le-lu-jah!
And sing thy great re-deem-er’s praise,
hal-le-lu-jah!
He >>just-ly claims a song from me,
hal-le-lu-jah!
His >>lov-ing >>kind-ness Oh! how free!
hal-le-lu-jah!

He saw me >>ru-in-ed in the fall,
hal-le-lu-jah!
Yet loved me, >not-with->>stand-ing all;
hal-le-lu-jah!
He saved me from my lost es-tate,
hal-le-lu-jah!
His >>lov-ing >>kind-ness Oh! how great!
hal-le-lu-jah!

Though num’rous hosts of >>might-y foes,
hal-le-lu-jah!
Though earth and hell my way op-pose,
hal-le-lu-jah!
He >>safe-ly leads my song a-long,
hal-le-lu-jah!
His >>lov-ing >>kind-ness Oh! how strong!
hal-le-lu-jah!
