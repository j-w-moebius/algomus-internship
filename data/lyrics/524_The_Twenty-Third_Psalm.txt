The Lord is my shep-herd;
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down
In green pas-tures:
He leadeth me be->>side the still Wa-ters.
He restoreth my soul:
He leadeth me in the paths
Of >>righ-teous-ness for His nameâ€™s sa-ke.
Yea, though I walk through the >>val-ley
Of the >>shad->ow of death,
I will fear no evil;
For Thou art with me;
Thy rod and Thy staff they >>com-fort me.
Thou preparest a >>ta-ble be->>fore me
In the >>pres-ence of my en-e-my-es:
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth o-ver;
>>sure-ly >>good-ness and >>mer-cy shall >>fol-low me
All the days of my life;
And I will dwell
In the house of the Lord for-ev-er.
