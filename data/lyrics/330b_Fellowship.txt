Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts to >>Chris-tian love;
The >>fel-low->ship of >>kin-dred minds
Is like to that a-bove.

We share our >>mu-tu-al woes,
Our >>mu-tu-al >>bur-dens bear;
And >>of-ten for each >>oth-er flows
The sym-pa-thize-ng tear.

When we asun->>der part,
It gives us >>in-ward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet a-gain.
