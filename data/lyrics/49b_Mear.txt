Will God for->>ev-er cast us off?
His wrath for->>ev-er smoke
a->>gainst the >>peo-ple of His love,
His >>lit-tle >>cho-sen flock.

Think of the tribes so >>dear-ly bought
With the re-deem-er’s blood,
Nor let Thy >>Zi-on be for-get,
Where once Thy >>glo-ry stood.

Where once Thy churches prayed and sang
Thy foes pro-fane-ly rage;
a->>mid Thy gates their en-signs hang,
And there their host en-gage.

And still to >>height-en our dis-tress,
Thy >>pres-ence is with-drawn;
Thy wont-ed signs of pow’r and grace
Thy pow’r and grace are gone.

No >>proph-et speaks to calm our grief,
But all in >>si-lence mourn;
Nor know the hour of our re-lief,
The hour of Thy re-turn.
