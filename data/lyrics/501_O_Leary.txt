And will the Judge de-scend,
And must the dead a-rise;
And not a >>sin-gle soul es->>cape
His all-dis-cern-ing eyes?

How will my heart en->>dure
The >>ter-rors of that day,
When earth and heav’n be->>fore His face
as->>ton-ished shrink a-way?

But ere the >>trum-pet shakes
The >>man-sions of the dead,
Hark, from the gos-pel’s cheering sound,
What >>joy-ful >>tid-ings spread.
