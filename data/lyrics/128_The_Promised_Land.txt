On Jor-dan’s >>storm-y banks I stand,
And cast a >>wish-ful eye,
To Ca-naan’s fair and >>hap-py land,
Where my pos->>ses-sions lie.

cho-rus:

I am bound for the >>prom-ised land,
I’m bound for the >>prom-ised land,
Oh, who will come and go with me,
I am bound for the >>prom-ised land.

Oh, the trans-port-ing, rapt’rous scene,
That rises to my sight,
Sweet fields ar->>ray-ed in >>liv-ing green,
And >>Riv-ers of de-light.

(cho-rus)

Filled with de-light, my rap-tured soul
Would here no >>long-er stay!
Though Jor-dan’s waves a->>round me roll,
>>fear-less I’d launch a-way.
