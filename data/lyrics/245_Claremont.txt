>>vi-tal spark of heav’nly flame
Quit, oh? quit this >>mor-tal frame;
trem-ble-ng, hoping, ling’ring, fly-ing.
Oh, the pain, the bliss of dy-ing?

Cease, fond na-ture, cease thy strife,
And let me >>lan-guish >>in-to life.
Hark! they whis-per; >>an-gels say,
“sis-ter spir-it, come a-way.”

What is this ab->>sorbs me quite —
Steals my senses, shuts my sight?
Drowns my spir-it, draws my breath?
Tell me, my soul, can this be death?

The world re-cedes, it dis-ap-pears,
Heav’n opens on my eyes, my ears
With sounds se-raph-ic ring,
Lend your wings! I mount! I fly!
Oh gra-ve! where is thy vic-to-ry?
Oh death! where is thy sting?
