In the be->>gin-ning was the Word,
And the Word was with God,
And the Word was God.
The same was in the be->>gin-ning with God.
All things were made by Him,
And with->>out Him was not >>any-thing made
That was made.
In Him was life; and the life was the light of men,
And the light shineth in dark-ness,
And the >>dark-ness comprehendeth it not.
There was a man sent from God,
Whose name was John,
Who came to bear >>wit-ness of that light,
That all men through Him might be-lieve.
John was not that Light,
But was sent to bear >>wit-ness of that light,
The true light that cometh >>in-to the world,
And the world was made by Him.
