In the bright >>sea-son of thy youth,
In na-ture’s smiling bloom,
Ere age ar-rives, and trem-ble-ng waits
Its >>sum-mons to the tomb.

re->>mem-ber thy cre-a-tor, God;
For Him thy pow’rs em-ploy;
Make Him thy fear, thy love, thy hope,
Thy >>por-tion and thy joy.

The Lord will >>safe-ly guide thy course
O’er life’s un->>cer-tain seas.
And bring thee to the >>peace-ful shore,
The heav’n pre->>pared for thee.
