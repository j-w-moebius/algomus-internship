O ring the bells of >>heav-en high,
The >>mar-riage feast has come,
The >>glo-ri-ous >>ju-bi->lee is nigh,
The saints are >>go-ing home;
The >>might-y penants of the skies
Are waving in the air,
And oâ€™er the gates of >>Zi-on rise
The >>bat-tle-ments so fair.

The King is >>mus-ter-ing His guests;
I see His >>glo-ri-ous band;
I see the >>shin-ing ha-bi-tants
Of far-off >>Beu-lah land;
They come, they come on wings of light,
I hear the >>bu-gle blast,
I know the reign of sinâ€™s dark night
for-ev-er-more is past.

From cloud to cloud, from dome to dome,
The >>myr-i-ad >>ar-my cries,
The >>mar-riage of the Lamb has come,
The >>mar-riage in the skies;
Come, bring the >>lin-en white and clean,
The >>wed-ding guests pre-pare,
The >>gar-ments gleam like >>sil-very sheen,
The >>brid-al robe so fair.

The bride-groom, too, me-thinks I see
While >>myr-i-ad voices ring,
chief-est a->>mong ten thou-sand,
He Im-man-u-el, my King,
Thrice >>bless-ed are they who hear the call,
A >>might-y >>an-gel cries,
Haste to the >>sup-per of the Lamb,
The >>mar-riage in the skies.
