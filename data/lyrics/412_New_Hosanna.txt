Wake, Oh my soul, and hail the morn,
For >>un-to us a sav-ior’s born:
See how the >>an-gels wing their way
To >>ush-er in the >>glo-ri-ous day.

cho-rus:

glo-ry, glo-ry, let us sing,
While heav’n and earth His praises ring,
ho-san-na to the Lamb of God.

Hark! what sweet mu-sic, what a song,
Sounds from the bright ce->>les-tial throng;
Sweet song, whose >>melt-ing sounds >im->>part
Joy to each rap-tured list’ning heart.

(cho-rus)

Come, join the >>an-gels in the sky,
>>glo-ry to God who reigns on high;
Let peace and love on earth a-bound,
While time re->>volves and years roll ’round.
