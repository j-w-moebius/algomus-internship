Ye wea-ry, heav-y-lad-en souls
Who are op->>pressed and sore,
Ye trav’lers through the >>wil-der-ness
To Ca-naan’s >>peace-ful shore,
Though >>chill-ing winds and >>beat-ing rains,
And >>Wa-ters deep and cold,
And en-e-my-es sur->>round-ing us,
Take >>cour-age and be bold.

fare-well, my >>breth-ren in the Lord,
Who are for >>Ca-naan bound,
And should we >>nev-er meet a->>gain
Till Ga-bri-el’s trump shall sound,
I hope that I shall meet you there
On that de->>light-ful shore,
In >>man-sions of eter->>nal bliss,
Where >>part-ing is no more.
