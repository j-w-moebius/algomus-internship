When >>Ad-am was cre-ated,
He dwelt in E-den’s shade;
As >>Mo-ses has re-lat-ed,
be->>fore a bride was made.
Ten >>thou-sand times ten >>thou-sand
Of >>crea-tures swarmed a-round,
be->>fore a bride was formed,
Or any ma-té was found.

He had not con-so-la-tion,
But seemed as one a-lone,
Till, to his ad-mi-ra-tion,
He found he’d lost a bone.
This >>wom-an was not >>tak-en
From Ad-am’s head, we know;
And she must not rule o’er him,
It’s >>ev-i-dent-ly so.

This wom-an, she was >>tak-en
From near to Ad-am’s heart,
By which we are di->>rect-ed
That they should >>nev-er part.
The book that’s called the bi-ble,
Be sure you don’t ne-glect;
For in >>ev-ery sense of du-ty,
It will you both di-rect.

The >>wom-an is com->>mand-ed
To do her hus-band’s will,
In >>ev-ery thing that’s >>law-ful
Her >>du-ty to ful-fill.
Great was his ex-ul-ta-tion,
To see her by his side;
Great was his >el-e->>va-tion
To have a >>lov-ing bride.

This wom-an, she was >>tak-en
From >>un-der Ad-am’s arm;
And she must be pro->>tect-ed
From >>in-ju-ry and harm.
This >>wom-an was not >>tak-en
From Ad-am’s feet, we see;
And she must not be abused,
The >>mean-ing seems to be.

The >>hus-band is com->>mand-ed
To love his >>lov-ing bride;
And live as does a Chris-tian,
And for his house pro-vide.
The >>wom-an is com->>mand-ed
Her >>hus-band to o-bey,
In >>ev-ery thing that’s law-ful,
un->>til her >>dy-ing day.
