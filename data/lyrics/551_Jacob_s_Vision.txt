As >>Ja-cob with >>trav-el was >>wea-ry one day,
And at night on a stone for a >>pil-low he lay,
There he saw in a >>vi-sion a >>lad-der so high,
That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.

cho-rus:

>al-le->>lu-ia to >>Je-sus who died on the tree,
And hath raised up a >>lad-der of >>mer-cy for me.

The >>lad-der is long, it is strong and well-made,
It stood >>hun-dreds of years, and is not yet de-cay-ed;
>>man-y >>mil-lions have climbed it and reached Zi-onâ€™s hill,
And the >>thou-sands by faith are now >>climb-ing it still.

(cho-rus)

Come, let us as-cend! All may climb it who will,
For the >>an-gels of >>Ja-cob are guarding it still.
There are >>re-gions of light, there are >>man-sions of bliss,
Oh, then, who would not climb such a >>lad-der as this?
