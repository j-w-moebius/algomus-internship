Ye souls who are bound >>un-to Ca-naan,
Come join in and help me to sing
The praises of my >>lov-ing Je-sus,
My proph-et, my Priest, and my King.

His name is most >>sweet-ly me-lo-di-ous,
‘Twill help you most >>swift-ly to move,
While >>Je-sus him->>self is the lead-er,
We’re bound by the cords of His love.
