The >>morn-ing sun shines from the east,
And spreads his glo-ry-es to the west,
All >>na-tions with his beams are blest,
Where’er the >>ra->di-ant light ap-pears.

So >>sci-ence spreads her >>lu-cid ray
O’er lands which long in >>dark-ness lay:
She >>vis-its fair Co-lum-bia,
And sets her sons a->>mong the stars.

Fair >>free-dom her at->>ten-dant waits,
To bless the >>por-tals of her gates,
To crown the young and >>ris-ing states
With >>lau-rels of >im->>mor-tal day:

The >>Brit-ish yoke, the >>Gal-lic chain,
Was urged up->>on our necks in vain,
All >>haugh-ty >>ty-rants we dis-dain,
And shout, Long live Amer-i-ca.
