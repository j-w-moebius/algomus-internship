fare-well, my friends, I’m bound for Ca-naan,
I’m trav’ling through the wil-der-ness;

Your >>com-pa->ny has been de-light-ful,
You, who doth leave my mind dis-tressed.

I go a-way, be->>hind to leave you,
per->>haps >>nev-er to meet a-gain,

But if we >>nev-er have the plea-sure,
I hope we’ll meet on Ca-naan’s land.
