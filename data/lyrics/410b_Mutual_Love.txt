Oh when shall I see >>Je-sus
And reign with Him a-bove,
And from the >>flow-ing >>foun-tain
Drink >ev-er->>last-ing love?
When shall I be de->>liv-er-ed
From this vain world of sin,
And with my >>bless-ed >>Je-sus
Drink >>end-less >>plea-sures in?

But now I am a sol-dier,
My cap-tain’s gone be-fore;
He’s >>giv-en me my or-ders,
And bids me ne’er give o’er.
His >>prom-ises are >>faith-ful —
A >>righ-teous crown He’ll give,
And all His >>val-iant >>sol-diers
eter->>nal-ly shall live.
