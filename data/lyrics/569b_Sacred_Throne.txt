be->>neath the >>sa-cred throne of God
I saw a >>riv-er rise;
The streams where peace and pard’ning blood
de->>scend-ed from the skies.

I stood amazed and >>won-der-ed when
Or why this >>o-cean ro-sé;
That wafts sal->>va-tion down to man,
His >>trai-tors and His foes.

That >>sa-cred flood from Je-sus’ veins
Was free to make a-way;
And Mar-y’s or Ma-nas-seh’s stains,
Or sins more vile than they
