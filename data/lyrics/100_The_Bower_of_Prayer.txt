To leave my dear friends, and with >>neigh-bors to part,
And go from my home it af->>fects not my heart
Like thoughts of ab-sent-ing >my->>self for a day
From that bless’d re->>treat where I’ve >>cho-sen to pray.

Dear bow’r, where the pine and the >>pop-lar have spread,
And wove with the branches a roof o’er my head;
How oft have I knelt on the >>ev-er->green there,
And poured out my soul to my >>sav-ior in pray-er.

The >>ear-ly shrill notes of the loved >>night-in-gale
That dwelt in my bow’r I ob->>served as my bell,
To call me to du-ty, while birds of the air
Sang >>an-thems of praise as I went to my pray-er.
