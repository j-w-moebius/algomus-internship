He saw me >>sink-ing in dis-tress,
And flew to my re-lief,
For me He bore the >>shame-ful cross,
And car-ry-ed all my grief.

cho-rus:

To Him I owe my life and breath
And all the joys I have,
He makes me >>tri-umph >>o-ver death,
And saves me from the gra-ve.

To heavâ€™n the place of His a-bode,
He brings my >>wea-ry feet;
Shows me the glo-ry-es of my God,
And makes my joys com-plete.
