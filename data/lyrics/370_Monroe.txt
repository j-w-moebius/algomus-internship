Je-sus, I my cross have tak-en,
All to leave and >>fol-low Thee;
na-ked, poor, de-spised, for-saken,
Thou, from hence, my all shall be.
per-ish, ev’ry fond am-bi-tion,
All I’ve sought or hoped or known;
Yet how rich is my con-di-tion,
God and heav’n is still my own.

Let the world de->>spise and leave me;
They have left my sav-ior, too;
>>hu-man hearts and looks de->>ceive me;
Thou art not, like them, un-true.
And while Thou shall smile up->>on me,
God of wis-dom, love and might,
Foes may hate and friends dis->>own me;
Show Thy face, and all is bright.

Man may >>trou-ble and dis->>tress me,
’Twill but drive me to Thy breast;
Life with >>tri-als hard may press me;
Heav’n will bring me sweeter rest.
Oh, ’tis not in grief to harm me,
While Thy love is left to me!
Oh ’twere not in joy to charm me,
Were that joy un->>mixed with Thee.
