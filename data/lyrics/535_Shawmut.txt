Oh that I could re-pent!
With all my idols part,
And to Thy >>gra-cious eye pres-ent,
A >>hum-ble con->>trite heart.

A heart with grief op-pressed,
For >>hav-ing grieved my God;
A >>trou-bled heart that >>can-not rest,
Till >>sprin-kled with Thy blood.

>>Je-sus on me be->>stow
The >>pen-i-tent de-sire:
With true sin->>cer-i-ty of woe
My >>ach-ing breast in-spire.

With soft’ning >>pit-y look,
And melt my >>hard-ness down;
Strike the love’s re-sist-less stroke,
And break this heart of stone.
