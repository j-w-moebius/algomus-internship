He dies, the friend of >>sin-ners dies,
Lo! Sa-lem’s >>daugh-ters weep a-round;
A >>sol-emn >>dark-ness veils the skies,
A >>sud-den trem-ble-ng shakes the ground.

Ye saints ap-proach! the >>an-guish view
Of Him who groans be->>neath your load,
He gives His >>pre-cious life for you,
For you He sheds His >>pre-cious blood.

Here’s love and grief be->>yond de-gree:
The Lord of >>glo-ry dies for men;
But lo! what >>sud-den joys we see!
Je-sus, the dead, re->>vives a-gain.

The >>ris-ing God for-sakes the tomb;
Up to His fa-ther’s court He flies,
cher->>ub-ic >>le-gions guard Him home,
And shout Him >>wel-come to the skies.
