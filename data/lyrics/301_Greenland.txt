With songs and >>hon-ors >>sound-ing loud,
>>ad->dress the Lord on high,
>>o-ver the heav’ns He spreads His clouds,
And >>Wa-ters veil the sky.
He sends His show’rs of >>bless-ing down
To cheer the plains be-low;
He makes the grass the >>moun-tains crown;
And corn in >>val-leys grow.

His >>stead-y >>coun-sels change the face
Of each de->>clin-ing year
He bids the sun cut short his race
And >>win-try days ap-pear.
On us His >>prov-i-dence has shone,
With >>gen-tle >>shin-ing rays;
Oh, may our lips and lives make known
His >>good-ness and His praise.
