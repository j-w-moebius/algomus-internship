I would see >>Je-sus when the flow’rs
Of joy a->>dorn my way;
When >>sun->shine and when hope sur->>rounds
My path from day to day.
When friends I >>cher-ish most are near,
And hearts en->>cir-cle mine,
Then, fa-ther, would I turn from all
To lean a->>lone on Thine.

I heard the voice of >>Je-sus say,
“be-hold, I >>free-ly give
The >>liv-ing wa-ter, >>thirst-y one;
Stoop down and drink and live!”
I came to >>Je-sus and I drank
Of that life-giv-ing stream;
My thirst was quenched,
My soul re-vived,
And now I live in Him.

I heard the voice of >>Je-sus say,
“I am this dark world’s light,
Look >>un-to me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day shall be bright!”
I looked to >>Je-sus and I found
In Him my star, my sun;
And in that light of life I’ll walk,
Till trav’ling days are done.
