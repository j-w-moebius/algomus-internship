I find >my->>self placed in a state of pro-ba-tion,
Which God has com->>mand-ed us well to im-prove.
And I am re->>solved to re->>gard all His pre-cepts,
And on in the way of obed’ence to move.
I know I must go through great trib-u-la-tion,
And >>man-y sore con->>flicts on >>ev-ery hand;
But grace will sup->>port and >>com-fort my spir-it,
And I shall be >>a-ble for->>ev-er to stand.

I’m called to con->>tend with the >>Pow-ers of dark-ness,
And >>man-y sore con->>flicts I have to pass through.
Oh Je-sus, be with me in >>ev-ery bat-tle,
And help me my en-e-my-es all to sub-due.
If Thou, >>gra-cious Lord, will >>on-ly be with me,
To aid and di->>rect me, then all will be right;
Apol-lyon, with all his >>pow-er-ful forces,
In Thy name and Thy strength shall soon put to flight.
