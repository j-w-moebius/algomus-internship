Why do we mourn de->>part-ing friends,
Or shake at deathâ€™s alarms?
â€™Tis but the voice that >>Je-sus sends,
To call them to His arms.

Why should we >>trem-ble to con->>vey
Their bodies to the tomb?
There the dear flesh of >>Je-sus lay,
And >>van-ish-ed all the gloom.

Thence He a-rose, as->>cend-ed high,
And showed our feet the way;
Up to the Lord our souls shall fly,
At the great >>ris-ing day.
