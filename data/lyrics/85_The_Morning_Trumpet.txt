Oh when shall I see Je-sus,
And reign with Him a-bove,
And shall hear the >>trum-pet sound in that morn-ing?
And from the >>flow-ing >>foun-tain
Drink >ev-er->>last-ing love,
And shall hear the >>trum-pet sound in that morn-ing?

cho-rus:

Shout, Oh glo-ry! for I shall mount a->>bove the skies,
When I hear the >>trum-pet sound in that morn-ing.

When shall I be de->>liv-er-ed
From this vain world of sin,
And shall hear the >>trum-pet sound in that morn-ing?
And with my >>bless-ed Je-sus,
Drink >>end-less >>plea-sures in,
And shall hear the >>trum-pet sound in that morn-ing?

(cho-rus)

But now I am a sol-dier,
My cap-tain’s gone be-fore;
He’s >>giv-en me my or-ders,
And bids me ne’er give o’er;

His >>prom-ises are >>faith-ful —
A >>righ-teous crown He’ll give,
And all His >>val-iant >>sol-diers
eter->>nal-ly shall live.

Through grace I feel de->>ter-mined
To con-quer, though I die,
And then away to >>Je-sus
On wings of love I’ll fly;

>fare->>well to sin and sor-row,
I bid them both a-dieu!
And, Oh my friends, prove faith-ful,
And on your way pur-sue.

Whene’er you meet with trou-bles,
And >>tri-als on your way,
Then cast your care on Je-sus,
And don’t for->>get to pray.

Gird on the >>gos-pel >>ar-mor
Of faith, and hope, and love,
And when the com-bat’s ended,
He’ll >>car-ry you a-bove.

Oh do not be dis-cour-aged,
For >>Je-sus is your Friend;
And if you lack for knowl-edge,
He’ll not re->>fuse to lend.

>>nei-ther will He >>up->braid you,
Though >>of-ten you re-quest,
He’ll give you grace to con-quer,
And take you home to rest.
