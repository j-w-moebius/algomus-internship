The >>spir-its of Wash-ing-ton, war-ren, Mont-gom-ery,
Look down from the clouds with bright >>as->pect se-rene.
Come, sol-diers, a tear and a toast to their mem’ry,
re->>joic-ing they’ll see us as they once have been.

To us the high boon, by the gods has been granted,
To spread the glad >>tid-ings of >>lib-er->ty far.
Let >>mil-lions >in->>vade us, we’ll meet them un-daunt-ed,
And >>con-quer or die by the Amer->>i-can Star.
