Travâ€™ler haste, the night comes on,
>>man-y a >>shin-ing hour is gone;
Storm is >>gath-er-ing in the west,
And you are so far from home.

cho-rus:

Oh, come, travâ€™ler, haste a-way,
You must walk while it is day.
Oh, come, travâ€™ler, haste a-way,
You will find Christ in the way.

Far from home thy >>foot->steps stray;
Christ the life and Christ the way.
Christ the light, yon >>set-ting sun,
Ere the noon is scarce be-gin.

(cho-rus)

>>ris-ing >>tem-pest sweeps the sky,
Rains de-scend, the winds are high,
>>Wa-ters swell and death and fear
Sets thy path no >>ref-uge near.
