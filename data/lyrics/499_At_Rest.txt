The world can >>nev-er give
The bliss for which we sigh;
’Tis not the whole of life to live,
Nor all of death to die.

be->>yond this vale of tears
There is a life a-bove,
un-mea-sured by the flight of years,
An >>end-less life of love.

fare-well, dear friends, fare-well,
For just a >>lit-tle while;
We’ll meet and sing on heav-en’s shore,
Where >>part-ing comes no more.
