Yes, my >>na-tive land, I love thee,
All thy scenes I love them well,
Friends, connections, >>hap-py coun-try,
Can I bid you all fare-well?

cho-rus:

Can I leave you,
Far in >>dis-tant lands to dwell?

Home, thy joys are >>pass-ing love-ly,
Joys no >>strang-er heart can tell;
>>hap-py home >in->>deed I love thee;
Can I, can I, say “fare-well?”

(cho-rus)

Scenes of >>sa-cred peace and plea-sure,
>>ho-ly days and >>Sab-bath bell,
Richest, brightest, sweetest trea-sure,
Can I say a last fare-well?
