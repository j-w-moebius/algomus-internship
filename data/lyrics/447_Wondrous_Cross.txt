When I sur->>vey the >>won-drous cross
On which the Prince of >>glo-ry died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour con->>tempt on all my pride.
for->>bid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I >>sac-ri->fice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
>>sor-row and love flow >>min-gled down!
Did eâ€™er such love and >>sor-row meet,
Or thorns com->>pose so rich a crown?
Were the whole realm of >>na-ture mine,
That were a >>pres-ent far too small;
Love so amaz-ing, so di-vine,
de->>mands my soul, my life, my all.
