Young la-dies, all at->>ten-tion give,
You that in >>wick-ed >>plea-sures live;
One of your sex, the >>oth-er day,
Was called by death’s cold hand a-way.

This >>les-son she has left for you,
To teach the >>care-less what to do;
To seek Je->>ho-vah while you live,
And >ev-er->>last-ing >>hon-ors give.

Her >>hon-or-ed >>moth-er she ad-dress-ed,
While tears were >>stream-ing down her breast;
She grasped her >>ten-der hands and said,
“re-mem-ber me when I am dead.”

She called her >>fa-ther to her bed,
And thus, in >>dy-ing >>an-guish said:
“My days on earth are at an end,
My soul is >>sum-mon-ed to at-tend.”

“be-fore Je-ho-vah’s >>aw-ful bar,
To hear my >>aw-ful >>sen-tence there;
And now, dear fa-ther, do re-pent,
And read the >>ho-ly tes-ta-ment.”
