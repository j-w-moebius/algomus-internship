a-wake, my soul, in >>joy-ful lays,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
And sing thy great re-deem-er’s praise,
Don’t you love God!
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

cho-rus:

There’s >>un-ion in heav’n,
And there’s >>un-ion in my soul,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
Sweet >>mu-sic in Zi-on’s be->>gin-ning to roll,
Don’t you love God!
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!

He saw me >>ru-in-ed by the fall,
Yet loved me, >not-with->>stand-ing all;

(cho-rus)

I >>of-ten feel my >>sin-ful heart,
Prone from my >>sav-ior to de-part,

(cho-rus)

But though I have Him oft for-get,
His >>lov-ing >>kind-ness changes not!
