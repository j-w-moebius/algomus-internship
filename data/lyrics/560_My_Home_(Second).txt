We are told there is a home
In a land be->>yond the sky,
I hope to reach that >>hap-py place
Where the soul >>nev-er dies,
And when my >>bless-ed >>sav-ior bids me come,

Then I shall live in heav’n a-bove,
And see my sav-ior’s face.
I’ll thank Him for His Son
And Praise Him for His >>sav-ing grace,
And >>won-ders of His love.
