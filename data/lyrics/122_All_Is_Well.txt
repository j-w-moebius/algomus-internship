What’s this that steals up->>on my frame?
Is it death, is it death?
That soon will quench this >>mor-tal flame,
Is it death, is it death?
If this be death, I soon shall be
From ev’ry pain and >>sor-row free.
I shall the King of >>glo-ry see,
All is well, all is well.

Weep not, my friends, weep not for me,
All is well, all is well!
My sins forgiv’n and I am free,
All is well, all is well!
There’s not a cloud that doth a-rise,
To hide my >>Je-sus from my eyes.
I soon shall mount the >>up-per skies,
All is well, all is well.

Tune, tune your harps ye saints on high,
All is well, all is well!
I too will strike my harp with >>e-qual joy,
All is well, all is well!
Bright >>an-gels are from >>glo-ry come,
They’re ’round my bed, they’re in my room,
They wait to waft my >>spir-it home,
All is well, all is well.

Hark! Hark! my Lord and mas-ter’s voice,
Calls a-way, calls a-way!
I soon shall see — >en->>joy my >>hap-py choice,
Why de-lay, why de-lay?
>fare->>well my friends, a-dieu, a-dieu,
I can no >>long-er stay with you,
My >>glit-ter-ing crown ap->>pears in view,
All is well, all is well!
