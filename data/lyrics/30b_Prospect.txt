Why should we start and fear to die?
What tim’rous worms we >>mor-tals are!
Death is the gate to >>end-less joy,
And yet we dread to >>en-ter there.

The pains, the groans, the >>dy-ing strife,
Fright our ap->>proach-ing souls a-way;
And we shrink back a->>gain to life,
Fond of our >>pris-on and our clay.

Oh if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul would stretch her wings in haste,
Fly >>fear-less through death’s >>i-ron gate,
Nor feel the >>ter-rors as she passed.

>>Je-sus can make a >>dy-ing bed
Feel soft as >>down-y >>pil-lows are;
While on His breast I lean my head,
And breathe my life out >>sweet-ly there.
