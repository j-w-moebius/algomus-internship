As pants the hart for >>cool-ing streams,
When >>heat-ed in the chase;
So longs my soul, Oh God, for Thee,
And Thy re->>fresh-ing grace.
Oh, for con->>vert-ing grace, and oh,
For sanc-ti-fy-ing pow’r;
Lord, we ask in Je-sus’ name,
A sweet, re->>fresh-ing show’r.

For Thee, my God, the >>liv-ing God,
My >>thirst-y soul doth re-pine;
Oh, when shall I be->>hold Thy face,
Thy >>maj-es-ty di-vine?
Why rest-less, why cast down, my soul?
Hope still; and thou shalt sing
Praise of Him who is thy God,
Thy health’s eter->>nal spring.
