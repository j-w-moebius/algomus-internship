There is a land of pure de-light,
Where saints >im->>mor-tal reign;
>>in-fi-nite day ex->>cludes the night,
And >>plea-sures >>ban-ish pain.

There >ev-er->>last-ing spring abides,
And >>nev-er with’ring flow’rs;
Death, like a >>nar-row sea, di->>vides
This heav’nly land from ours.

Sweet fields, be->>yond the >>swell-ing flood
Stand dressed in >>liv-ing green,
So to the Jews old >>Ca-naan stood,
While >>Jor-dan rolled be-tween.

But tim’rous >>mor-tals start and shrink
To cross this >>nar-row sea,
And lin-ger, shiv’ring on the brink,
And fear to launch a-way.

Oh! could we make our doubts re-move,
Those >>gloom-y doubts that rise,
And see the >>Ca-naan that we love
With un-beclouded eyes.

Could we but climb where >>Mo-ses stood
And view the >>land->scape o’er,
Not Jor-dan’s stream nor death’s cold flood
Should fright us from the shore.
