Thou art >>pass-ing a-way,
Thy life has been brief as a >>mid->>sum-mer day;
Thy >>fore-head is pale, and thy pulses are low,
And thy once >>bloom-ing cheek bears an >>om-i-nous glow.

Thou art >>pass-ing a->>way from the >>beau-ti-ful earth,
Thy much loved a-bode, and the land of thy birth;
From its >>for-ests and fields, from its >>mur-mur-ing rills,
From its >>beau-ti-ful plains and its herb-age-crowned hills.

Thou art >>pass-ing a->>way from thy >>kin-dred and friends,
And the last chain that bound thee, the >>spoil-er now rends;
And thy last tones are >>fall-ing on loveâ€™s listâ€™ning ear,
And now in thine eye shines the fond, >>part-ing tear.
