Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet ac-cord,
And thus sur->>round the throne.

Let those re->>fuse to sing
Who >>nev-er knew our God;
But >>chil-dren of the heav’nly King
May speak their joys a-broad.

Then let our songs a-bound,
And ev’ry tear be dry;
We’re >>march-ing through Im-man-u-el’s ground
To fairer worlds on high.
