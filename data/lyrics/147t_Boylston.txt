My God, my life, my love,
To Thee, to Thee I call;
I >>can-not live if Thou re-move,
For Thou art all in all.

Thy >>shin-ing grace can cheer
This >>dun-geon where I dwell;
’Tis >>par-a->dise when Thou art here,
If Thou de-part, ’tis hell.

The smilings of Thy face,
How >>ami-a-ble they are;
’Tis heav’n to rest in Thine em-brace,
And >>no->where else but there.

To Thee, and Thee a->>lone
The >>an-gels owe their bliss;
They sit a->>round Thy >>gra-cious throne,
And dwell where >>Je-sus is.

Not all the harps a->>bove
Can make a heav’nly place;
If God His >>res-i-dence re-move,
Or but con->>ceal His face.
