Young peo-ple, hear me as your friend,
Whose days on earth are at an end;
Your >>tal-ents to the >>sav-ior lend
And live for-ev-er-more.

His Word will guide you here be-low,
Great love and >>mer-cy He will show;
And then with >>Je-sus you may go
And live for-ev-er-more.

With you no >>long-er I may dwell,
But His great love for you I tell;
Iâ€™m >>read-y now to bid >fare->>well
And live for-ev-er-more.
