Far from my thoughts, vain world, be gone,
Let my re->>li-gious hours a-lone,
Fain would my eyes my >>sav-ior see,
I wait a vis-it, Lord, from Thee.

My heart grows warm with >>ho-ly fire,
And kin-dles with a pure de-sire.
Come, my dear Je-sus, from a-bove,
And feed my soul with heavâ€™nly love:

Blest Je-sus, what de->>li-cious fare!
How sweet Thine >en-ter->>tain-ments are!
>>nev-er did >>an-gels taste a-bove,
re->>deem-ing grace and >>dy-ing love.
