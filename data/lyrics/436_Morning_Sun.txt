Youth, like the spring, will soon be gone,
By >>fleet-ing time or conqu’ring death;
Your >>morn-ing sun may set at noon,
And leave you >>ev-er in the dark.

Your spar-kle-ng eyes and >>bloom-ing cheeks
Must >>with-er like the >>blast-ed ro-sé;
The cof-fin, earth, and >>wind-ing sheet
Will soon your >>ac-tive limbs en-close.
