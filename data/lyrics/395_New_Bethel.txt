Oh for a >>thou-sand tongues to sing
My great re-deem-er’s praise;
The glo-ry-es of my God and King,
The >>tri-umphs of His grace.
My >>gra-cious >>mas-ter and my God,
as->>sist me to pro-claim,
To spread through all the earth a->>broad
The >>hon-ors of Thy name.

Je-sus, the name that charms our fears,
That bids our >>sor-rows cease;
’Tis >>mu-sic in the sin-ner’s ears,
’Tis life and health and peace.
He breaks the pow’r of >>can-cel-ed sin,
He sets the pris’ner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me.
