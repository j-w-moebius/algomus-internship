re-mem-ber, Lord, our >>mor-tal state;
How frail our lives! how short the date!
Where is the man that draws his breath,
Safe from dis-ease, se->>cure from death?

Lord, while we see whole >>na-tions die,
Our flesh and sense re-pine and cry;
Must death for->>ev-er rage and reign?
Or hast Thou made >>man->>kind in vain?
