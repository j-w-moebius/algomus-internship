Long have I sat be->>neath the sound
Of Thy sal-va-tion, Lord,
And still how weak my faith is found
And >>knowl-edge of Thy word.

How cold and >>fee-ble is my love!
How >>neg-li-gent my fears!
How long my hopes of joys a-bove;
How few af->>fec-tions there.

Show my for->>get-ful feet the way
That leads to joys on high,
Where >>knowl-edge grows with->>out de->>cay
And love shall >>nev-er die.
