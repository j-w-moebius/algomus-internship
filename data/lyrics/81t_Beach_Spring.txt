Come, ye sin-ners, poor and need-y,
Weak and wound-ed, sick and sore,
>>Je-sus >>read-y stands to save you,
Full of pit-y, love and pow’r.
He is a-ble,
He is will-ing, doubt no more.

Let not >>con-science make you lin-ger,
Nor of >>fit-ness >>fond-ly dream,
All the >>fit-ness He requireth
Is to feel your need of Him.
This He gives you,
’Tis the spir-it’s >>ris-ing beam.

>>ag-o-niz-ing in the gar-den,
Lo! your >>mas-ter >>pros-trate lies;
On the >>blood-y tree be->>hold Him,
Hear Him cry be->>fore He dies;
“It is fin-ished!”
>>sin-ners will this not suf-fice?

Lo! th’in-car-nate God as-cend-ed,
Pleads the >>mer-it of His blood;
>>ven-ture to Him, >>ven-ture whol-ly,
Let no >>oth-er trust in-trude.
None but Je-sus,
Can do >>help-less >>sin-ners good.
