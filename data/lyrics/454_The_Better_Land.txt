The road to >>glo-ry seems so long,
And >>sor-rows >>of-ten take my song;

cho-rus:

I’m >>go-ing to a >>bet-ter land,
Where >>trou-bles are un-known.
All >>sor-rows will be gone,
We’ll sing a->>round the throne in sweet ac-cord,
ador->>ing >>Je-sus our dear Lord.

From Je-sus’ side I will not stray,
I know he’ll guide me all the way.

(cho-rus)

I know it is not >>ver-y far
To >>heav-en where my >>trea-sures are.
