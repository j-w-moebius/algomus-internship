When I can read my >>ti-tle clear
To >>man-sions in the skies,
I’ll bid >fare->>well to ev’ry fear,
And wipe my >>weep-ing eyes.

cho-rus:

I feel like I’m on my >>jour-ney home.

Should earth a->>gainst my soul en-gage,
And >>fi-ery darts be hurled,
Then I can smile at Sa-tan’s rage,
And face a frowning world.

(cho-rus)

Let cares like a wild >>del-uge come,
Let storms of >>sor-row fall;
So I but >>safe-ly reach my home,
My God, my heav’n my all.

(cho-rus)

There I shall bathe my >>wea-ry soul
In seas of heav’nly rest,
And not a wave of >>trou-ble roll
a->>cross my >>peace-ful breast.
