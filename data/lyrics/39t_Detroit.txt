Do not I love Thee, Oh my Lord?
be->>hold my heart, and see,
And turn each cursed >>i-dol out,
That dares to >>ri-val Thee.

Do not I love Thee from my soul?
Then let me >>noth-ing love;
Dead be my heart to ev’ry joy
When >>Je-sus >>can-not move.

Thou know’st I love Thee, dearest Lord,
But Oh I long to soar
Far from the sphere of >>mor-tal joys,
And learn to love Thee more.
