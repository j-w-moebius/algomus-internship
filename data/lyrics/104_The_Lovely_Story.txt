A >>sto-ry most >>love-ly Iâ€™ll tell,
Of Je-sus, (O >>won-drous sur-prise),
He >>suf-fer-ed the >>tor->ments of hell,
That sin-ners, vile >>sin-ners may rise;
He left His ex->>alt-ed a-bode,
When man by trans->>gres-sion was lost,
ap-pease-ng the wrath of a God,
He shed forth His blood as the cost.

O did my dear >>Je-sus thus bleed,
And >>pit-y a >>ru-in-ed lost race;
O whence did such >>mer-cy pro-ceed,
Such >>bound-less com->>pas-sion and grace?
His >>bod-y bore >>an-guish and pain,
His >>spir-it most sunk with the load,
A short time be->>fore He was slain,
His sweat was as great drops of blood.
