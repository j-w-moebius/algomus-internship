I am a great com->>plain-er
That bears the name of Christ;
Come, all ye >>Zi-on mourners,
And >>lis-ten to my cries;
I’ve >>man-y sore temp->>ta-tions
And >>sor-rows to my soul;
I feel my faith de-clin-ing,
And my af->>fec-tions cold.

I wish it was with me now
As in the days of old,
The >>glo-ri-ous light of >>Je-sus
Was >>flow-ing in my soul,
But now I am dis-tressed,
And no re->>lief can find,
A hard, de->>ceit-ful heart
And a wretch-ed, wand’ring mind.

It is great pride and >>pas-sion
be->>set me on my way,
So I am filled with >>fol-ly
And so ne->>glect to pray;
I am so weak I stum-ble,
And so I’m left be-hind,
While >>oth-ers run re->>joic-ing
And seem to lose no time.
