While >>beau-ty and youth are in their full prime,
And >>fol-ly and >>fash-ion af->>fect our whole time;
Oh, let not the >>phan-tom our wishes en-gage;
Let’s live so in youth that we blush not in age.

I sigh not for beau-ty, nor >>lan-guish for wealth,
But grant me, kind prov-i-dence, >>vir-tue and health;
Then, richer than kings, and far hap-py-er than they,
My days shall pass >>swift-ly and >>sweet-ly a-way.

The vain and the young may at->>tend us a while,
But let not their flatt’ry our >>pru-dence be-guile.
Let’s >>cov-et those charms that shall >>nev-er de-cay,
Nor >>lis-ten to all that de-ceive-rs can say.
