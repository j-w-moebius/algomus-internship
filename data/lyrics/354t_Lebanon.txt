See, >>gra-cious God, be->>fore Thy throne,
Thy >>mourn-ing >>peo-ple bend,
’Tis on Thy sov’reign grace a-lone,
On Thee our >>hum-ble hopes de-pend.

How changed, a-las! are truths di-vine,
For er-ror, guilt, and shame!
What >im->>pi-ous Num-bers, bold in sin,
dis->>grace the >>ho-ly >>Chris-tian name!

Oh turn us, turn us, >>might-y Lord,
By Thy re-sist-less grace;
Then shall our hearts o->>bey Thy word,
And >>hum-ble we shall seek Thy face.
