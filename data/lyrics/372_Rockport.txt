My soul, be on thy guard;
Ten >>thou-sand foes a-rise;
The hosts of sin are >>press-ing hard
To draw thee from the skies.
Oh watch, and fight and pray;
The >>bat-tle ne’er give o’er;
re->>new it >>bold-ly ev’ry day,
And help di->>vine im-plore.

Ne’er think the vict’ry won,
Nor lay thine >>ar-mor down;
Thy >>ar-du-ous work will not be done
Till thou ob->>tain the crown.
Fight on, my soul, till death
Shall bring thee to thy God;
He’ll take thee, at thy >>part-ing breath,
To His di->>vine a-bode.
