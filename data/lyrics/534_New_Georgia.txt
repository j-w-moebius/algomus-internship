The >>might-y hand of God doth reign,
As in the ages past;
His blood has >>en-ter-ed death’s do->>main
To guide us home at last.
His praise we’ll sing the earth a-round,
And >>up-ward lift our eyes
While slumb’ring >>ten-ants of the ground
In >>liv-ing ar-my-es rise.

When sun and moon, and earth, and stars,
And time shall be no more,
Through His own blood and >>bat-tle scars,
We’ll land on Ca-naan’s shore.
His praise for->>ev-er we shall sing,
And mount the >>up-per sky;
And to the >>pal-ace of our king
On wings of love we’ll fly.
