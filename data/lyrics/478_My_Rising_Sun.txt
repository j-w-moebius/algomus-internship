God moves in a mys->>te-ri-ous way
His >>won-ders to per-form;
He plants His >>foot->steps in the sea
And rides up->>on the storm.
In darkest night when he ap->>pears
My >>sor-rows will be gone,
He is my soul’s sweet >>morn-ing star,
And he’s my >>ris-ing sun.

He forms the >>sin-ful man a-new,
sub-dues the love of sin;
He takes a->>way the heart of stone
And plants His grace with-in.
He came from heav’n our souls to save,
ap-ply-es re->>deem-ing blood,
Bids all our guilt and fears re-moved,
Leaves us at peace with God.
