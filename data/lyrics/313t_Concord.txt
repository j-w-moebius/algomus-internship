The men of grace have found,
>>glo-ry be->>gin be-low;
ce->>les-tial fruits on >>earth-ly ground,
From faith and hope may grow.

The hill of >>Zi-on yields,
A >>thou-sand >>sa-cred sweets,
be->>fore we reach the heav’nly fields,
Or walk the >>gold-en streets.

Then let our songs a-bound,
And ev’ry tear be dry;
We’re >>march-ing through Im-man-u-el’s ground,
To fairer worlds on high.
