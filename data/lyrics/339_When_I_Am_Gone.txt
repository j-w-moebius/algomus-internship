Shed not a tear o’er your friend’s >>ear-ly bier,
When I am gone.
Smile when the slow tolling bell you shall hear,
When I am gone.
Weep not for me as you stand ’round my gra-ve,
Think who has died His be->>loved to save,
Think of the crown all the ran-som-ed shall wear,
When I am gone.

Plant you a ro-sé that shall bloom o’er my gra-ve,
When I am gone.
Sing a sweet song such as >>an-gels may have,
When I am gone.
Praise ye the Lord that I’m freed from all care,
Pray ye the Lord that my joys ye shall share,
Look up on high and be->>lieve that I’m there,
When I am gone.
