The Lord is >>lead-ing me to-day,
His love shines all a-round;
de->>light I find a->>long the way,
For I am >>home-ward bound.
Soon the great call for me will come,
I’ll lay my >>ar-mor down,
From Him no more a->>gain to roam,
For I am >>home-ward bound.

I >>nev-er knew the >>hap-pi-ness
That in His love is found;
un->>til He came, my soul to bless,
And now I’m >>home-ward bound.
He raised me from the depths of sin,
To higher, >>sol-id ground;
I’m >>drink-ing >>end-less >>plea-sure in,
Since I am >>home-ward bound.

It will not give me cause to fear
To hear the >>trum-pet sound;
And as that >>hap-py time draws near,
I still am >>home-ward bound.
Soon I will strike the heav’nly lyre,
With saints of great re-nown,
And join that great harmon’ous choir;
Oh, I am >>home-ward bound!
