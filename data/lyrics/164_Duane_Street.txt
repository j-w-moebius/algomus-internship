A poor way-far-erg man of grief
Hath >>of-ten crossed me on my way;
Who sued so >>hum-ble for re->>lief
That I could >>nev-er >>an-swer nay.
I had no pow’r to ask his name,
>>whith-er he went or whence he came;
Yet there was >>some-thing in his eye
That won my love, I knew not why.

I spied him where a >>foun-tain burst
Clear from the rock; his strength was gone;
The heed-less >>wa-ter mocked his thirst;
He heard it, saw it >>hur-ry-ing on.
I ran and rais’d the suff’rer up;
Thrice from the stream he drained my cup,
Dipped and re->>turn-ed it >>run-ning o’er:
I drank and >>nev-er thirsted more.

In pris’n I saw him next, con->>demned
To meet a trai-tor’s doom at morn,
The tide of >>ly-ing tongues I stemm’d
And >>hon-or-ed him ’mid shame and scorn.
My friend-ship’s >>ut->most zeal to try,
He asked if I for him would die:
The flesh was weak, my blood ran chill,
But the free >>spir-it cried, “I will.”

Then in a >>mo-ment to my view
The >>strang-er started from dis-guise:
The >>to-kens in His hands I knew —
My >>sav-ior stood be->>fore my eyes.
He spake and my poor name He named:
“Of me thou hast not been a-shamed;
These deeds shall thy me->>mo-ri-al be:
Fear not, thou didst it >>un-to me.”
