When you see them —

cho-rus:

I’m a poor, >>mourn-ing pil-grim,
I’m bound for Ca-naan’s land.
I weep, and I mourn,
And I move >>slow-ly on —
I’m a poor, >>mourn-ing pil-grim,
I’m bound for Ca-naan’s land.

You may tell them, moth-er,
When you see them —

(cho-rus)

You may tell them, broth-er,
When you see them —

(cho-rus)

You may tell them, sis-ter,
When you see them —
