Je-sus, what shall I do to show
How much I love Thy >>charm-ing name?
Let my whole heart with >>rap-ture glow,
Thy >>bound-less >>good-ness to pro-claim.

Lord, if a >>dis-tant glimpse of Thee
Can give such sweet, such vast de-light,
What must the joy, the >>tri-umph be,
To dwell for->>ev-er in Thy sight?
