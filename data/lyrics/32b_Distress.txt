So fades the >>love-ly >>bloom-ing flow’r,
Frail, smiling >>so-lace of an hour;
So soon our >>tran-sient >>com-forts fly,
And >>plea-sure >>on-ly blooms to die.

Is there no kind, no >>heal-ing art,
To soothe the >>an-guish of the heart?
>>spir-it of grace, be >>ev-er nigh;
Thy >>com-forts are not made to die.

Let >>gen-tle >>pa-tience smile on pain,
Till >>dy-ing hope re->>vives a-gain,
Hope wipes the tear from sor-row’s eye,
And faith points >>up-ward to the sky.
