While trav’ling through the world be-low,
Where sore af->>flic-tions come,
My soul abounds with joy to know
That I will rest at home.

cho-rus:

>>car-ry me home, when my life is o’er;
Then >>car-ry me to my long-sought home,
Where pain is felt no more.

My soul’s de->>light has been to sing
Of >>glo-ri-ous days to come,
When I shall, with my God and King,
for->>ev-er rest at home.

(cho-rus)

Yes when my eyes are closed in death,
My >>bod-y cease to roam,
I’ll bid >fare->>well to all be-low,
And meet my friends at home.

(cho-rus)

And then I want these lines to be
>in->>scribed up->>on my tomb,
“Here lies the dust of SRP,
His >>spir-it sings at home.”
