How pleased and blest was I,
To hear the >>peo-ple cry,
“Come let us seek our God to-day;”
Yes, with a >>cheer-ful zeal,
We haste to Zi-on’s hill,
And there our vows and >>hon-ors pay.

May peace at->>tend Thy gate,
And joy with->>in Thee wait,
To bless the soul of ev’ry guest;
The man that seeks Thy peace,
And wishes Thine in-crease,
A >>thou-sand >>bless-ings on him rest.
