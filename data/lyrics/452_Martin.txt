Je-sus, >>lov-er of my soul,
Let me to Thy >>bos-om fly,
While the nearer >>Wa-ters roll,
While the >>tem-pest still is high!
Hide me, Oh my sav-ior, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe >>in-to the >>ha-ven guide;
Oh re->>ceive my soul at last.

>>oth-er >>ref-uge I have none,
Hangs my >>help-less soul on Thee:
Leave, ah! leave me not a-lone,
Still sup->>port and >>com-fort me;
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring,
>>cov-er my de->>fense-less head
With the >>shad->ow of Thy wing.

Wilt Thou not re->>gard my call?
Wilt Thou not ac->>cept my pray-er?
Lo! I faint, I sink, I fall
Lo! on Thee I cast my care.
Reach me out Thy >>gra-cious Hand,
While I of Thy strength re-ceive,
Hoping a->>gainst hope I stand,
dy-ing, and be->>hold I live!
