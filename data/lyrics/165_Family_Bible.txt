How >>pain-ful-ly >>pleas-ing the fond >rec-ol->>lec-tion
Of >>youth-ful con->>nec-tion and >>in-no-cent joy,
While >>bless-ed with par->>ent-al ad->>vice and af-fec-tion,
sur->>round-ed with >>mer-cy and peace from on high.
I still view the chairs of my >>fa-ther and moth-er,
The seats of their off-spring, as ranged on each hand,
And the richest of books, which ex->>cels ev’ry oth-er,
The >>fam-i-ly >>bi-ble that lay on the stand.

The bi-ble, that >>vol-ume of God’s in-spi-ra-tion,
At >>morn-ing and ev’ning could yield us de-light.
The >>pray-ers of our fa-ther, a sweet in-vo-ca-tion,
For >>mer-cy by day and for >>safe-ty at night.
Oh hymns of >thanks->>giv-ing with harmon’ous sweet-ness,
As warmed by the hearts of the >>fam-i-ly band,
Hath raised us from earth to that rap-ture-us >>dwell-ing
de->>scribed in the >>bi-ble that lay on the stand.
