>>wea-ry >>sol-diers of the cross, seek rest
With the >>sav-ior as your guide;
Lay your head up->>on His heav’nly breast,
And in peace e’ermore a-bide.

In that last sad hour, mid friends so dear,
Death, your trem-ble-ng soul will free;
And a fa-ther’s >>lov-ing voice you’ll hear,
say-ing, “Wand’rer, come to me.”
