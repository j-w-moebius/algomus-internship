On Jor-dan’s >>storm-y banks I stand,
And cast a >>wish-ful eye,
To Ca-naan’s fair and >>hap-py land
Where my pos->>ses-sions lie.
Oh the trans-port-ing, rap-ture-us scene
That rises to my sight!
Sweet fields ar->>ray-ed in >>liv-ing green,
And >>Riv-ers of de-light.

There gen’rous fruits that >>nev-er fail,
On trees >im->>mor-tal grow;
There rocks and hills and brooks, and vales,
With milk and >>hon-ey flow.
All o’er those wide, ex->>tend-ed plains
Shines one eter->>nal day!
There God the Son for->>ev-er reigns,
And scat-ters night a-way.
