As on the cross the >>sav-ior hung,
And wept, and bled, and died;
He poured sal->>va-tion on a wretch
That >>lan-guish-ed at His side.

His crimes, with >>in-ward grief and shame,
The >>pen-i-tent con-fess-ed,
Then turned his >>dy-ing eyes to Christ,
And thus his >>pray-er ad-dress-ed.

“Je-sus Thou Son and heir of heav’n?
Thou >>spot-less Lamb of God!
I see Thee bathed in sweat and tears,
And welt’ring in Thy blood.”

“Yet >>quick-ly from these scenes of woe
In >>tri-umph Thou shalt rise,
Burst through the >>gloom-y shades of death,
And shine a->>bove the skies.”

“a-mid the glo-ry-es of that world,
Dear sav-ior, think on me,
And in the vic-to-ry-es of Thy death
Let me a >>shar-er be.”

His >>pray-er the >>dy-ing >>Je-sus hears,
And >>in-stant-ly re-ply-es,
“to-day thy >>part-ing soul shall be
With me in par-a-dise.”
