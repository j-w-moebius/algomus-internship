The cross of Christ >in->>spires my heart
To sing re->>deem-ing grace;
a-wake, my soul, and bear a part
In my re-deem-er’s praise.
Oh, who can be com->>pared to Him
Who died up->>on the tree?
This is my dear de->>light-ful theme,
That >>Je-sus died for me.

A >>glo-ri-ous band, the >>cho-sen few,
On whom the >>spir-it came,
Twelve >>val-iant saints, their hope they knew,
And mocked the cross and flame;
Oh God, to us may grace be giv’n
To >>fol-low in their train.
Through per-il, toil and pain they climbed
The steep as->>cent to heav’n.
