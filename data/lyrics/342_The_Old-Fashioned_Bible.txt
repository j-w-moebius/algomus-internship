I still view the chairs of my >>fa-ther and moth-er,
Their >>off->spring as seated and ranged on each hand,
And the richest of books, which ex->>cels ev’ry oth-er,
The >>fam-i-ly >>bi-ble that lay on the stand.

The >old->>fash-ion-ed bi-ble, the dear >>bless-ed bi-ble!
The >>fam-i-ly >>bi-ble that lay on the stand.

Where ser-aphs and >>an-gels re->>peat the glad >>sto-ry
Of Je-sus’ great >>mer-cy to >>sin-ners con-fess-ed.
They range the bless’d fields on the banks of the riv-er,
sur->>vey-ing the breadth of Im-man-u-el’s land;
And they love Him and praise Him for->>ev-er and ev-er,
The >>fam-i-ly >>bi-ble that lay on the stand.
