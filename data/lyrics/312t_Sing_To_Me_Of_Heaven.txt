Oh, sing to me of heav’n,
When I am called to die,
Sing songs of >>ho-ly ec-sta-sy,
To waft my soul on high.

When cold and >>slug-gish drops
Roll off my >>mar-ble brow,
Burst forth in strains of joy-ful-ness,
Let heav’n be->>gin be-low.

When the last >>mo-ment comes,
Oh, watch my >>dy-ing face,
And catch the bright, se-raph-ic gleam,
Which on each >>fea-ture plays.

Then to my rav-ish-ed ear
Let one sweet song be-gin,
Let >>mu-sic charm me last on earth,
And greet me first in heav’n.

Then close my sight-less eyes,
And lay me down to rest,
And clasp my cold and >>i-cy hands
a->>cross my >>peace-ful breast.

Then ’round my >>sense-less clay
as->>sem-ble those I love,
And sing of heav’n, de->>light-ful heav’n,
My >>glo-ri-ous home a-bove.
