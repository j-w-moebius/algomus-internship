The time is >>swift-ly >>roll-ing on,
When I must faint and die;
My >>bod-y to the dust re-turn,
And there for-get-ten lie.

Let >per-se->>cu-tion rage a-round,
And An-ti-christ ap-pear,
My >>si-lent dust be->>neath the ground,
There’s no dis->>tur-bance there.

My >>broth-er preach-ers, fare you well,
Your >>fel-low->ship I love;
In time no more I shall you see,
And soon we’ll meet a-bove.
