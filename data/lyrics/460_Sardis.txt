Come on, my >>fel-low pil-grims, come,
And let us all be hast’ning home,
We soon shall land on yon blest shore,
Where pains and >>sor-rows are no more,
There we our >>Je-sus shall a-dore,
for->>ev-er blest.

No >>pe-ri-od then our joys shall know
se->>cure from ev’ry >>mor-tal foe;
No >>sick-ness there, no want or pain
Shall e’er dis->>turb our rest a-gain,
When with >>Im-man-u-el we reign,
for->>ev-er blest.
