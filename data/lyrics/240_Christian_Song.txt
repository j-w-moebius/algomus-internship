Mine eyes are now >>clos-ing to rest,
My >>bod-y must soon be re-moved,
And mouldâ€™ring, lie buried in dust,
No more to be en-vy-ed or loved.

Ah! what is this >>draw-ing my breath,
And >>steal-ing my senses a-way?
Oh tell me, my soul, is it death,
re-lease-ng me >>kind-ly from clay?

Now mount-ing, my soul shall de-scry,
The >>re-gions of >>plea-sure and love,
My >>spir-it tri->>um-phant shall fly,
And dwell with my >>sav-ior a-bove.
