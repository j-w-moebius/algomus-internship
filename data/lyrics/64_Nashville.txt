The Lord >>in-to His >>gar-den comes,
The spices yield their rich perfumes,
The lilies grow and thrive;
re->>fresh-ing show’rs of grace di->>vine
From >>Je-sus flow to ev’ry vine,
Which make the dead re-vive.

Oh that this dry and >>bar-ren ground
In springs of >>wa-ter may a-bound,
A >>fruit-ful soil be-come;
The >>de-sert blossoms as the rose,
While >>Je-sus conquers all His foes,
And makes His >>peo-ple one.

Come, breth-ren, ye that love the Lord,
Who taste the >>sweet-ness of His word,
In Je-sus’ ways go on;
Our troubles and our trials here
Will >>on-ly make us richer there,
When we ar->>rive at home.

The >>glo-ri-ous time is >>roll-ing on,
The >>gra-cious work is now be-gin,
My soul a >>wit-ness is;
I taste and see the >>par-don free
For all >>man->>kind as well as me,
Who come to Christ may live.
