My soul re->>peat His praise,
Whose mer-cy-es are so great,
Whose >>an-ger is so slow to rise,
So >>read-y to a-bate.

High as the heav’ns are raised,
a->>bove the ground we tread,
So far the >>rich-es of His grace,
Our highest thoughts ex-ceed.

His pow’r sub-dues our sins,
And His for->>giv-ing love,
Far as the east is from the west,
Doth all our guilt re-move.
