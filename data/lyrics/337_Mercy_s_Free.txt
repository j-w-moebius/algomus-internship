What’s this that in my soul is ris-ing?
Is it grace? Is it grace?
Which makes me keep for >>mer-cy cry-ing,
Is it grace? Is it grace?
This work that’s in my soul be-gin,
It makes me strive all sin to shun,
It plants my soul be->>neath the sun,
mer-cy’s free! mer-cy’s free!

Great God of love, I can but won-der,
mer-cy’s free! mer-cy’s free!
Though I’ve no price at all to ten-der,
mer-cy’s free, mer-cy’s free!
Though mer-cy’s free, our God is just,
And if a soul should e’er be lost,
This will >>tor->ment the >>sin-ner most;
mer-cy’s free! mer-cy’s free!

This truth through all our life shall cheer us,
mer-cy’s free! mer-cy’s free!
And through the vale of death shall bear us,
mer-cy’s free! mer-cy’s free!
And when to Jor-dan’s bank we come,
And cross the >>rag-ing bil-lows’ foam,
We’ll sing, when >>safe-ly >>land-ed home:
mer-cy’s free! mer-cy’s free!
