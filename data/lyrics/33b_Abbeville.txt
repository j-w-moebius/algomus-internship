Come, >>ho-ly >>spir-it come,
With >>en-er-gy di-vine,
And on this poor, be->>night-ed soul,
With beams of >>mer-cy shine.

Melt, melt this >>fro-zen heart;
This >>stub-born will sub-due;
Each evil >>pas-sion over-come,
And form me all a-new.

Mine will the >>prof-it be,
But Thine shall be the praise;
And >>un-to Thee will I de->>vote
The >>rem-nant of my days.
