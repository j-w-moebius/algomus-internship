Oh, if my Lord should come and meet,
My soul would stretch her wings in haste,
Fly >>fear-less through death’s >>i-ron gate,
Nor feel the >>ter-rors as she passed.

>>Je-sus can make a >>dy-ing bed
Feel soft as >>down-y >>pil-lows are,
While on His breast I lean my head,
And breathe my life out >>sweet-ly there.
