My soul for-sakes her vain de->>light
And bids the world fare-well;
Base as the dirt be->>neath the feet
And >>mis-chie-vous as hell.
No >>long-er will I ask your love,
Nor seek your >>friend-ship more;
The >>hap-pi-ness that I ap->>prove
Is not with->>in your pow’r.

There’s >>noth-ing ’round this >>spa-cious earth
That suits my soul’s de-sire;
To >>bound-less joy and >>sol-id mirth
My >>no-bler thoughts as-pire.
Oh, for the pin-ions of a dove
To mount the heav’nly road;
There shall I share my sav-ior’s love,
There shall I dwell with God.
