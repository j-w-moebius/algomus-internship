Thou Man of grief, re->>mem-ber me,
Who >>nev-er canst >thy->>self for-get.
Thy last ex-pire-ng ag-o-ny,
Thy >>faint-ing pangs and >>blood-y sweat.

fa-ther, if I may call Thee so,
re->>gard my >>fear-ful heartâ€™s de-sire;
re->>move this load of >>guilt-y woe,
Nor let me in my sins ex-pire!

I trem-ble, lest the wrath di-vine,
Which bruises now my >>wretch-ed soul,
Should bruise this >>wretch-ed soul of mine,
Long as eter->>nal ages roll.
