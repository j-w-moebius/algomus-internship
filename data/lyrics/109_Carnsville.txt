I love my >>bless-ed sav-ior,
I feel I’m in His fa-vor,
And I am His for->>ev-er
If I but >>faith-ful prove;
And now I’m bound for Ca-naan,
I feel my sins for-given,
And soon shall get to >>heav-en
To sing re->>deem-ing love.

Poor >>sin-ners may de->>ride me,
And un-be-liev-ers chide me,
But >>noth-ing shall di->>vide me
From Je-sus, my best friend;
sup->>port-ed by His pow-er,
I long to see the hour
That bids my >>spir-it tow-er,
And all my >>trou-bles end.

The >>pleas-ing time is hast’ning,
My tott’ring frame is wast-ing,
Whilst I’m en->>gaged in praising,
>im->>pel-led by His love.
When >>yon-der >>shin-ing or-ders,
Who sing on Ca-naan’s bor-ders,
Shall bear me to the Lord there,
To praise His name a-bove.
