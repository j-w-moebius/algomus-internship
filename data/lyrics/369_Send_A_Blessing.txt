Oh, tell me no more
Of this world’s vain store,
The time for such >>tri-fles with me now is o’er.
A >>coun-try I found
Where true joys a-bound;
To dwell I’m de->>ter-mined on that >>hap-py ground.

cho-rus:

Send a bless-ing, send a >>bless-ing just now.

The souls that be-lieve,
In >>par-a->dise live,
And me in that >>num-ber will >>Je-sus re-ceive;
My soul, don’t de->>lay —
He calls thee a-way;
Rise, >>fol-low Thy >>sav-ior and bless the glad day.

(cho-rus)

But this do I find:
We too are so joined,
He’ll not live in >>glo-ry and leave me be-hind;
So this is the race
I’m >>run-ning through grace,
>>hence->>forth till ad->>mit-ted to see my Lord’s face.

(cho-rus)
