fare-well, vain world! I’m >>go-ing home!
My >>sav-ior smiles and bids me come,
And I don’t care to stay here long!

Sweet >>an-gels >>beck-on me a-way,
To sing God’s praise in >>end-less day,
And I don’t care to stay here long!

cho-rus:

Right up yon-der, Chris-tians, a->>way up yon-der;
Oh, yes, my Lord, for I don’t care to stay here long.

I’m glad that I am born to die,
From grief and woe my soul shall fly,
And I don’t care to stay here long!

Bright >>an-gels shall con->>vey me home,
a->>way to New Je-ru-sa-lem,
And I don’t care to stay here long!
