fare-well, my friends, weep not for me;
I’m >>go-ing home to God;
I’ll >>trav-el in the >>sa-cred way,
The path our >>fa-thers trod.
I’ll meet my friends who’ve gone be-fore,
a->>round the great white throne;
We’ll shout and sing for-ev-er-more,
And know as we are known.

My joy through life has been to sing
Of Him who died for me,
And when I stand be->>fore the King,
His >>bless-ed face I’ll see.
All >>glo-ry to the Son of God,
Who died up->>on the tree;
We’ll shout and sing with one ac-cord,
Through all eter-ni-ty.
