Life is the time to serve the Lord,
The time t’in-sure the great re-ward;
And while the lamp holds out to burn
The vilest >>sin-ner may re-turn.

Life is the hour that God has giv’n,
To es->>cape hell and fly to heav’n;
The day of grace, and >>mor-tals may
se->>cure the >>bless-ing of the day.

The >>liv-ing know that they must die,
But all the dead for-get-ten lie;
Their mem’ry and their sense is gone,
a->>like un->>know-ing and un-known.
