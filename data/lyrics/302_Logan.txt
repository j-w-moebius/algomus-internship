The day is past and gone,
The >>eve-ning shades ap-pear;
Oh may we all re->>mem-ber well,
The night of death draws near;

cho-rus:

And when our days are past,
And we from time re-move,
Oh may we in Thy >>bos-om rest,
The >>bos-om of Thy love,
So death will soon dis-robe us all
Of what we here pos-sess.

Lord, keep us safe this night,
se->>cure from all our fears;
My >>an-gels guard us while we sleep,
Till >>morn-ing light ap-pears.

(cho-rus)
