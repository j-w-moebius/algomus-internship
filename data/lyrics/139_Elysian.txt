Burst, ye >>em-er-ald gates, and bring
To my rap-tured >>vi-sion
All th’ec-stat-ic joys that spring
’Round the bright ely-sian.
Lo, we lift our >>long-ing eyes,
Burst, ye in-ter-vene-ng skies,
Sun of righ-teous-ness, a-rise;
Ope the gates of par-a-dise.

Floods of >ev-er->>last-ing light
>>free-ly flash be->>fore Him;
myr-i-ads, with su->>preme de-light,
>>in-stant-ly a->>dore Him.
>>an-gel trumps >re->>sound His fame,
Lutes of >>lu-cid gold pro->>claim
All the >>mu-sic of His name;
>>heav-en echoing the theme.

Four-and-twen-ty >>el-ders rise
From their >>prince-ly sta-tion;
Shout His >>glo-ri-ous vic-to-ry-es,
Sing the great sal-va-tion;
Cast their crowns be->>fore His throne,
Cry in >rev-er->>en-tial tone,
“glo-ry give to God a-lone,
ho-ly, ho-ly, >>ho-ly One!”
