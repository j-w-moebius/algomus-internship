How firm a foun-da-tion, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His >>ex-cel-lent word,
What more can He say than to you He hath said,
Ye who >>un-to >>Je-sus for >>ref-uge have fled.

“Fear not, I am with thee; Oh be not dis-mayed!
I, I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
I’ll >>strength-en thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
up->>hold by my righ-teous, om->>nip-o-tent hand.”

“When through the deep >>Wa-ters I call thee to go,
The >>Riv-ers of >>sor-row shall not over-flow;
For I will be with thee, thy >>trou-bles to bless,
And >>sanc-ti-fy to thee thy deepest dis-tress.”

“The soul that on >>Je-sus hath leaned for re-pose,
I will not, I will not >>des-ert to His foes.
The soul, though all hell should en->>deav-or to shake,
I’ll nev-er, no nev-er, no >>nev-er for-sake.”
