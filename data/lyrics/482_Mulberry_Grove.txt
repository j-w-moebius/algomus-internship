My sands of life are >>run-ning fast,
I can’t >>re->call one >>mo-ment past;
I’ve much to do in >>lit-tle space,
O can I yet be saved by grace?
O can I yet one >>ef-fort make?

Thus far the Lord has led me on,
And I am near my >>fi-nal home;
So I must halt, re->>count my thoughts,
And tell the world I’m saved by grace;
This >>ef-fort is my choice to make.
