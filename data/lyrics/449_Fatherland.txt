There is a place where my hopes are stayed,
My heart and my >>trea-sures are there,
Where >>vir-tues and >>bless-ings >>nev-er face,
And fields are eter->>nal-ly fair.

That >>bliss-ful place is my fa-ther-land,
By faith its de->>lights I ex-plore,
Come, >>fa-vor my flight, >an->>gel-ic band,
And waft me in peace to the shore.
