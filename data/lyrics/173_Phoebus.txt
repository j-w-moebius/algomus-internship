Lord, in the >>morn-ing Thou shalt hear
My voice as->>cend-ing high:
To Thee will I di->>rect my pray-er,
To Thee lift up mine eye;
Up to the hills where Christ is gone
To plead for all His saints,
pres->>ent-ing at His fa-ther’s throne
Our songs and our com-plaints.

Thou art a God be->>fore whose sight
The >>wick-ed shall not stand;
>>sin-ners shall ne’er be Thy de-light,
Nor dwell at Thy right hand,
But to Thy house will I re-sort,
To taste Thy mer-cy-es there;
Thy word >>in-to our minds in-still;
And >>wor-ship in Thy fear.
