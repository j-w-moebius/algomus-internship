There is a land of pure de-light,
Where saints >im->>mor-tal reign;
>>in-fi-nite day ex->>cludes the night,
And >>plea-sures >>ban-ish pain.
There >ev-er->>last-ing spring abides,
And >>nev-er with’ring flow’rs;
Death like a >>nar-row sea di->>vides
This heav’nly land from ours.

There I shall bathe my >>wea-ry soul
In seas of heav’nly rest,
And not a wave of >>trou-ble roll
a->>cross my >>peace-ful breast.
When we’ve been there ten >>thou-sand years,
Bright >>shin-ing as the sun;
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first be-gin.
