Je-sus, and shall it >>ev-er be,
A >>mor-tal man a->>shamed of Thee?
a->>shamed of Thee whom >>an-gels praise,
Whose glo-ry-es shine through >>end-less days.

a->>shamed of Je-sus! just as soon
Let >>mid->night be a->>shamed of noon;
’Tis >>mid->night with my soul till He,
Bright >>morn-ing star, bids >>dark-ness flee.

a->>shamed of Je-sus, >>soon-er far
Let >>eve-ning blush to own a star;
He sheds the beams of light di->>vine
O’er this be->>night-ed soul of mine.

a->>shamed of Je-sus, that dear Friend
On whom my hopes of heav’n de-pend!
No, when I blush, be this my shame,
That I no more re->>vere His name.
