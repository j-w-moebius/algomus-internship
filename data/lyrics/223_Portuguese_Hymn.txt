hith-er, ye faith-ful, haste with songs of tri-umph,
To >>Beth-le->hem haste, the Lord of life to meet;
To you this day is born a Prince and sav-ior;
Oh come, and let us >>wor-ship at His feet.

Shout His al->>mighty name, ye choirs of an-gels,
And let the ce->>les-tial courts His praise re-peat;
>>un-to our God be >>glo-ry in the highest,
Oh come, and let us >>wor-ship at His feet.
