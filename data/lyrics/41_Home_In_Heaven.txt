A home in heav’n! What a >>joy-ful thought,
As the poor man toils in his >>wea-ry lot:
His heart op-pressed, and with >>an-guish driv’n
From his home be->>low to his home in heav’n.

A home in heav’n as the >>suf-fer lies
On his bed of pain, and up-lifts his eyes
To that bright home, what a joy is giv’n,
From the >>bless-ed thought of his home in heav’n.

A home in heav’n when the faint heart bleeds
By the >>spir-it stroke for its evil deeds;
Oh! then what bliss in that heart for-giv-en,
Does the hope >in->>spire of its home in heav’n.

A home in heav’n when our friends are fled
To the cheer-less gloom of the mould’ring dead;
We wait in hope on the >>prom-ise giv-en,
That we’ll meet up there in our home in heav’n.
