The time is >>swift-ly >>roll-ing on
When I must faint and die;
My >>bod-y to the dust re-turn,
And there for-get-ten lie.
My >>lit-tle chil-dren, near my heart,
And >>na-ture seems to bind;
It grieves me >>sore-ly to de->>part
And leave you all be-hind.

Let >per-se->>cu-tion rage a-round,
And An-ti-christ ap-pear,
My >>si-lent dust be->>neath the ground,
Thereâ€™s no dis->>tur-bance there.
Though I can >>nev-er come to thee;
Let not this grieve your heart;
For you will >>short-ly come to me,
Where we shall >>nev-er part.
