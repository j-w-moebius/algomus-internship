Oh for a >>clos-er walk with God,
A calm and heav’nly frame,
A light to shine up->>on the road
That leads me to the Lamb!

Where is the >>bless-ed-ness I knew,
When first I saw the Lord?
Where is the soul-re-fresh-ing view
Of >>Je-sus and His word?

What >>peace-ful hours I once en-joy-ed!
How sweet their mem’ry still!
But they have left an >>ach-ing void
The world can >>nev-er fill.

re->>turn Oh >>ho-ly Dove, re-turn,
Sweet >>mes-sen-ger of rest!
I hate the sins that made Thee mourn,
And drove Thee from my breast.

The dearest >>i-dol I have known,
Whate’er that >>i-dol be,
Help me to tear it from Thy throne,
And >>wor-ship >>on-ly Thee.

So shall my walk be close with God,
Calm and se->>rene my frame,
So purer light shall mark the road
That leads me to the Lamb.
