I am the ro-sÃ© of Sha-ron, and the >>Lil-y of the val-ley.
As the >>Lil-y a->>mong the thorns,
So is my love a->>mong the >>daugh-ters
As the >>ap-ple tree a->>mong the trees of the wood,
So is my be->>loved a->>mong the sons.
I sat down >>un-der his >>shad->ow with great de-light,
And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
He brought me to the ban-quet-ing house;
His >>ban-ner >>o-ver me was love.
Stay me with flag-ons,
>>com-fort me with ap-ples,
For I am sick of love.

I charge you, Oh ye >>daugh-ters of Je-ru-sa-lem,
By the roes, and by the hinds of the field,
That you stir not up, nor a->>wake my love till he please.
The voice of my be-loved,
be-hold! he cometh, >>leap-ing up->>on the moun-tains,
Skipping up->>on the hills.

My be->>loved spake, and said >>un-to me,
Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come a-way.
For lo, the >>win-ter is past,
The rain is >>o-ver and gone.
