O land of rest, for thee I sigh:
When will the >>mo-ment come
When I shall lay my >>ar-mor by,
And dwell in peace at home?

No >>tran-quil joy on earth I know,
No peace-ful, >>shel-ter-ing dome;
This world’s a >>wil-der-ness of woe,
This world is not my home.
This world’s a >>wil-der-ness of woe,
O this is not my home.

Our tears shall all be wiped a->>way
When we have ceased to roam,
And we shall hear our >>fa-ther say,
Come dwell with me at home.
