fare-well, vain world, I’m >>go-ing home,
Where there’s no more >>storm-y clouds to rise.
My >>sav-ior smiles and bids me come,
Where there’s no more >>storm-y clouds to rise.

cho-rus:

To the land I am bound,
Where there’s no more >>storm-y clouds to rise.

Sweet >>an-gels >>beck-on me a-way,
Where there’s no more >>storm-y clouds to rise.
To sing God’s praise in >>end-less day,
Where there’s no more >>storm-y clouds to rise.
