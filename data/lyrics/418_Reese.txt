There is a house not made with hands,
eter->>nal and on high;
And here my >>spir-it >>wait-ing stands,
Till God shall bid it fly.

cho-rus:

I long to see my friends a-gain,
And hear them >>sweet-ly say,
Come, >>wea-ry dove, here is thy home,
Then fold thy wings and stay.

>>short-ly this >>pris-on of my clay
Must be dis->>solved and fall;
Then, Oh my soul, with joy o->>bey
Thy heav’nly fa-ther’s call.

(cho-rus)

’Tis He, by His al->>mighty grace,
That forms thee fit for heav’n;
And as an >>ear-nest of the place,
Has His own >>spir-it giv’n.
