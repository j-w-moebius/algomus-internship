Oh, why should I >>wan-der a >>strang-er from Thee,
Or cry in the >>des-ert for bread?
My foes will re->>joice all my >>sor-rows to see,
And smile at the tears I have shed.
Ye >>daugh-ters of Zi-on, de-clare, have you seen
The star that on >>Is-ra-el shone?
Say, if in your tents my be->>loved has been,
And where with His flocks He has gone.

Oh Thou, in whose >>pres-ence my soul takes de->>light
On whom in af->>flic-tion I call;
My >>com-fort by day and my song in the night
My hope, my sal-va-tion, my all.
Where dost Thou at >>noon->time re->>side with Thy sheep
To feed on the >>pas-tures of love?
Say why in the >>val-ley of death should I weep,
Or >>lone-ly the >>wil-der-ness rove?
