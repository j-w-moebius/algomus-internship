Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry bless-ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mer-cy, >>nev-er ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

cho-rus:

Bless the Lord, Oh my soul!
Praise the Lord, Oh my broth-er!
Shout and sing, Oh my sis-ter!
Give Him glo-ry, Oh my fa-ther!
And re-joice, Oh my moth-er!
And we’ll >>trav-el on to-geth-er,
And we’ll join heart and hands for Ca-naan.

Teach me some me->>lo-di-ous son-net,
Sung by >>flam-ing tongues a-bove;
Praise the mount, Oh fix me on it,
Mount of God’s un->>chang-ing love.

(cho-rus)

Oh, to grace how great a >>debt-or
>>dai-ly I’m con->>strain-ed to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fet-ter,
Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.

(cho-rus)
