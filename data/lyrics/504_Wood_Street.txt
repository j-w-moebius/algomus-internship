When we our wea-ry-ed limbs to rest
Sat down by proud Eu-phra-tesâ€™ stream:
We wept with >>dole-ful thoughts op-pressed,
And >>Zi-on was our >>mourn-ful theme.

Our harps that when with joy we sung
Were wont their >>tune-ful parts to bear,
With >>si-lent strings ne->>glect-ed hung,
On >>wil->low trees that >>with-er-ed there.
