And am I born to die?
To lay this >>bod-y down!
And must my trem-ble-ng >>spir-it fly
>>in-to a world un-known?

A land of deepest shade,
un-pierced by >>hu-man thought;
The >>drea-ry >>re-gions of the dead,
Where all things are for-get!

Soon as from earth I go,
What will be->>come of me?
eter->>nal >>hap-pi-ness or woe
Must then my >>por-tion be!

Waked by the >>trum-pet sound,
I from my >>gra-ve shall rise;
And see the Judge with >>glo-ry crowned,
And see the >>flam-ing skies!
