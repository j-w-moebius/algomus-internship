A few more days on earth to spend,
And all my toils and cares shall end,
And I shall see my God and friend,
And praise His name on high.
No more to sigh or shed a tear,
No more to >>suf-fer pain or fear;
But God, and Christ, and heav’n ap->>pear
>>un-to the rap-tured eyes.

Then, O, my soul, de-spond no more:
The storms of life will soon be o’er,
And I shall find the >>peace-ful shore
Of >ev-er->>last-ing rest.
O >>hap-py day! O >>joy-ful hour!
When, freed from earth, my soul shall tow’r
be->>yond the reach of Sa-tan’s pow’r,
To be for->>ev-er blest.

To >>earth-ly cares I bid fare-well,
And >>tri-umph >>o-ver death and hell,
And go where saints and >>an-gels dwell,
To praise th’eter-nal Three.
I’ll join with those who’ve gone be-fore,
Who sing and shout, their suff’rings o’er,
Where pain and >>part-ing are no more,
To all eter-ni-ty.
