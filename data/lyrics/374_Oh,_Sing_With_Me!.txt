Oh! sing with me of >>so-cial spheres
Where breathes in >>kind-ness >>mu-tu-al love,
Where no un-gen-tle look ap-pears,
Though >>faith-ful->ness should ev’n re-prove,

Come, sing of all that’s bright and fair
In >>az-ure sky and beau-te-ous earth,
Oh, sing of heav’n, our hopes are there,
With >>trea-sures of >im->>mor-tal worth.
