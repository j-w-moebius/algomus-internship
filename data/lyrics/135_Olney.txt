Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry bless-ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace.
Streams of mer-cy, >>nev-er ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some me->>lo-di-ous son-net,
Sung by >>flam-ing tongues a-bove;
Praise the mount — I’m fixed up->>on it —
Mount of Thy re->>deem-ing love!

Here I’ll raise my eb-e-ne-zer,
hith-er, by Thy help, I’m come;
And I hope, by Thy good plea-sure,
>>safe-ly to ar->>rive at home.
>>Je-sus sought me when a strang-er,
Wand’ring from the fold of God;
He, to >>res-cue me from dan-ger,
in-ter-posed His >>pre-cious blood.
