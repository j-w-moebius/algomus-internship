My soul, be on thy guard;
Ten >>thou-sand foes a-rise;
The hosts of sin are >>press-ing hard
To draw thee from the skies.

Oh watch, and fight, and pray;
The >>bat-tle ne’er give o’er;
re->>new the >>con-flict ev’ry day;
And help di->>vine im-plore.

Ne’er think the vict’ry won,
Nor lay thine >>ar-mor down;
The work of faith will not be done
Till thou ob->>tain the crown.
