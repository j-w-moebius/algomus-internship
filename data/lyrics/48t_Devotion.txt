Sweet is the day of >>sa-cred rest;
No >>mor-tal cares shall seize my breast.
Oh, may my heart in tune be found,
Like Da-vid’s harp of >>sol-emn sound.

Then shall I share a >>glo-ri-ous part,
When grace hath well re->>fined my heart,
And fresh sup-ply-es of joy are shed,
Like >>ho-ly oil, to cheer my head.

Then shall I see, and hear, and know
All I de->>sired and wished be-low;
And ev’ry pow’r find sweet em-ploy,
In that eter->>nal world of joy.
