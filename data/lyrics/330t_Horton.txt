My span of life will soon be gone.
The >>pass-ing >>mo-ments say;
As length’ning >>shad->ows o’er the mead
pro->>claim the close of day.

My >>Chris-tian friends to whom I speak,
I have a crown in view;
My >>sin-ner friends, now will you seek,
How stands the case with you?

The love of Christ constraineth me,
Sin’s evil ways to shun,
And in the paths of >>righ-teous-ness
My race with >>pa-tience run.

The cross of Christ >in->>spires my heart
To sing re->>deem-ing grace;
a-wake, my soul, and bear a part
In my re-deem-er’s praise.

How, long, dear sav-ior, Oh, how long?
Shall this bright hour de-lay?
Fly swift a-round, ye wheels of time,
And bring the >>prom-ised day.

When we’ve been there ten >>thou-sand years,
Bright >>shin-ing as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise,
Than when we first be-gin.
