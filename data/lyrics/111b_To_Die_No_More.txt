Why should we start, and fear to die?
What tim’rous worms we >>mor-tals are,
Death is the gate of >>end-less joy,
And yet we dread to >>en-ter there.

cho-rus:

I’m >>go-ing home to Christ a-bove;
I’m >>go-ing to the Chris-tian’s rest,
To die no more, to die no more,
I’m >>go-ing home to die no more.

Oh, if my Lord would come and meet
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
Fly >>fear-less through death’s >>i-ron gate,
Nor feel the >>ter-rors as she passed.

(cho-rus)
