The char-i-ot! the char-i-ot! its wheels roll in fire,
As the Lord cometh down in the pomp of His ire!
Lo! self-mov-ing it drives on its >>path->way of cloud,
And the heav’ns with the >>bur-den of >>god->head are bowed.

The glo-ry! the glo-ry! a->>round Him are poured
>>might-y hosts of the >>an-gels that wait on the Lord;
And the glo-ri-fy-ed saints and the >>mar-tyrs are there,
And there all who the palm-wreaths of >>vic-to-ry wear.

The trum-pet! the trum-pet! the dead all have heard,
Lo, the depths of the stone-cov-er-ed char-nel are stirred:
From the sea, from the earth, from the south, from the north,
And the vast >gen-er->>a-tions of man are come forth.

The judg-ment! the judg-ment! the thrones are all set,
Where the Lamb and the white-vest-ed >>el-ders are met;
There all flesh is at once in the sight of the Lord,
And the doom of eter->>ni-ty hangs on His word.

O mer-cy! O mer-cy! look down from a-bove,
Great cre-a-tor, on us, Thy sad chil-dren, with love;
When be->>neath to their >>dark-ness the >>wick-ed are driv’n,
May our >>jus-ti->fied souls find a >>wel-come in heav’n.
