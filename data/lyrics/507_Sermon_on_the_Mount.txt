And >>see-ing the mul-ti-tudes,
He went up >>in-to a mount;
And when He was set,
His dis->>ci-ples came >>un-to Him.

He opened His mouth,
There >>bless-ings poured out
To the >>chil-dren a->>bout
And none were left out.

>>bless-ed are the pure in heart,
For they shall see the >>king-dom of heavâ€™n.

The meek He >>bless-ed with righ-teous-ness,
The weak, the dumb, the blind ones too,
Will sing to His praise when we all reach home.
