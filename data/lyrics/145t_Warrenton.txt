Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry bless-ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace.
Streams of mer-cy, >>nev-er ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

cho-rus:

I am bound for the king-dom,
Will you go to >>glo-ry with me?
hal-le-lu-jah, praise the Lord.

Oh, to grace how great a >>debt-or
>>dai-ly I’m con->>strain-ed to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fet-ter,
Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.

(cho-rus)

Prone to wan-der, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here’s my heart, Lord, take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts a-bove.
