Great God, let all my >>tune-ful powâ€™rs
a-wake, and sing Thy >>might-y name;
Thy hand re->>volves my cir-cle-ng hours,
Thy hand from whence my >>be-ing come.

Thus will I sing till >>na-ture cease,
Till sense and >>lan-guage are no more,
And >>af-ter death Thy >>bound-less grace
Through >ev-er->>last-ing years a-dore.
