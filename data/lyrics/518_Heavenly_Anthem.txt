The >>heav-ens de->>clare the >>glo-ry of God;
The fir-ma-ment showeth His hand-i-work,
Day >>un-to day uttâ€™reth speech,
Night >>un-to night showeth knowl-edge,
There is no speech nor >>lan-guage
Where their voice is not heard,
Their line is gone out through all the earth,
And their words to the end of the world.

The law of the Lord is per-fect,
con->>vert-ing the soul,
The >>tes-ti->mo-ny of the Lord is sure,
>>mak-ing the wise sim-ple,
The >>stat-utes of the Lord are right,
re->>joic-ing the heart:
The com->>mand-ment of the Lord is pure,
>en->>light-en-ing the eyes.

more-over, by them is Thy >>ser-vant warned.
Let the words of my mouth
And the >med-i->>ta-tions of my heart
Be ac->>cept-able in Thy sight, Oh Lord,
My strength and my re-deem-er.
