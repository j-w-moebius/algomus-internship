The Lord my >>pas-ture shall pre-pare,
And feed me with a shep-herdâ€™s care;
His >>pres-ence shall my wants sup-ply,
And guard me with a >>watch-ful eye;
My noon-day walks He shall at-tend,
And all my >>mid->night hours de-fend.

With >>gloom-y >>hor-rors over-spread,
Though in the paths of death I tread;
My >>stead->fast heart shall fear no ill,
For Thou, Oh Lord, art with me still;
Thy >>friend-ly crook shall give me aid,
And guide me through the >>dread-ful shade.
