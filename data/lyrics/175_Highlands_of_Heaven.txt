sin-ner, go, will you go,
To the >>High-lands of heav-en;
Where the storms >>nev-er blow,
And the long sum-mer’s giv-en?
Where the bright >>bloom-ing flow’rs
Are their odors emitting;
And the leaves of the bow’rs
On the breezes are flit-ting.

Where the saints robed in white,
Cleansed in life’s >>flow-ing foun-tain,
shin-ing, beau-te-ous, and bright,
Shall >in->>hab-it the moun-tain.
Where no sin, nor dis-may,
>>nei-ther trou-ble, or sor-row,
Will be felt for to-day,
Nor be feared for the mor-row.
