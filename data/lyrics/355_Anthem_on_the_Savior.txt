My friends, come >>lis-ten a-while,
And I will tell you a >>sto-ry
a->>bout our >>lov-ing sav-ior;
He came of low es-tate,
Was re->>ject-ed by His own,
Was born of the >>vir-gin Mar-y,
And was cra-dled in a man-ger.

The next we hear of this >>bless-ed sav-ior,
He was >>go-ing a->>bout >>do-ing good;
And >>teach-ing the >>peo-ple righ-teous-ness;
And for this He was con->>demned to die,
To which He con-sent-ed,
And in the act of >>dy-ing gave up the ghost,
And said, It is fin-ished!

Then He was buried,
And the third day,
He ro-sÃ© from the gra-ve,
A tri->>um-phant con-quer-or,

And as->>cend-ed to >>man-sions on high,
And is now ex->>alt-ed a Prince and a sav-ior,
And grants re->>pen-tance >>un-to men,

Then let us praise Him,
>>mag-ni->fy and a-dore,
World with->>out end. a-men.
