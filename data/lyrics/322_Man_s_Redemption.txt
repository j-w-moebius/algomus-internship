The >>glo-ri-ous plan of man’s re-demp-tion,
By the Son of God was wrought,
To save the lost and >>ru-in-ed na-tion,
So to heav’n we might be brought.

cho-rus:

glo-ry, hon-or, and sal-va-tion,
To the Lamb, who once was slain;
Sound His praise through ev’ry na-tion,
May it >>nev-er cease a-gain.

His >>pre-cious blood to save us streamed,
Lo! He sends sal->>va-tion free,
And now the poor by Him re-deem-ed,
Find both life and lib-er-ty.

(cho-rus)

And now, dear friends, what more is wanted,
Than what is al->>ready done?
Christ has to him->>self >>sin-ners granted,
Will you then to >>ru-in run?

(cho-rus)
