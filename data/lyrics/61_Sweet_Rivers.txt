Sweet >>Riv-ers of re->>deem-ing love
Lie just be->>fore mine eye,
Had I the pin-ions of a dove
I’d to those >>Riv-ers fly;
I’d rise su->>pe-ri-or to my pain,
With joy out->>strip the wind,
I’d cross o’er Jor-dan’s >>storm-y waves,
And leave the world be-hind.

A few more days, or years at most,
My >>trou-bles will be o’er;
I hope to join the heav’nly host
On Ca-naan’s >>hap-py shore.
My rap-tured soul shall drink and feast
In love’s un->>bound-ed sea:
The >>glo-ri-ous hope of >>end-less rest
Is >>rav-ish-ing for me.
