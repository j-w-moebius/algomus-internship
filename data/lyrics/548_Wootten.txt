I soon shall view the >>prom-ised land,
I soon shall sing with the an-gels’ band,
For Je-sus’ blood has made me free;
And I soon shall sing in eter-ni-ty.

I want to live for >>Je-sus ev’ry day,
I want to sing His praises once a-gain,
I want to feel that He is >>ev-er near,
To guard and guide my >>wea-ry soul
To that eter->>nal world of joy.
