Blow ye the >>trum-pet blow,
The >>glad-ly >>sol-emn sound;
Let all the >>na-tions know,
To earth’s re->>mote-st bound,

cho-rus:

The year of >>ju-bi->lee is come;
re-turn, ye ran-som-ed sin-ners, home.

ex->>tol the Lamb of God,
The all-atoning Lamb;
re->>demp-tion through his blood
through->>out the world pro-claim.

(cho-rus)

The >>gos-pel >>trum-pet hear,
The news of heav’nly grace;
And saved from earth ap->>pear
be->>fore your sav-ior’s face.
