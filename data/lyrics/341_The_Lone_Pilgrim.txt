I came to the place where the lone >>pil-grim lay,
And pen-sive-ly stood by his tomb.
When in a low >>whis-per I heard >>some-thing say,
“How >>sweet-ly he sleeps here a-lone.”

The >>tem-pest may howl, and the loud >>thun-ders roar,
And >>gath-er-ing storms may a-rise.
Yet calm are his feel-ings, at rest is his soul,
The tears are all wiped from his eyes.

The cause of his >>mas-ter pro->>pel-led him from home,
He bade his com->>pan-ions fare-well;
He >>bless-ed his dear chil-dren, who for him now mourn,
In far >>dis-tant >>re-gions they dwell.

He >>wan-der-ed an >>ex->ile and >>strang-er from home,
No >>kin-dred or >>rel-a-tive nigh;
He met the con->>ta-gion and sank to his tomb,
His soul flew to >>man-sions on high.

Oh tell his com->>pan-ions and >>chil-dren most dear:
To weep not for him, now he’s gone.
The same God that led Him through scenes most se->>vere
Has >>kind-ly as->>sist-ed him home.
