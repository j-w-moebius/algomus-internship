Oh, how >>hap-py are they,
Who their >>sav-ior o-bey,
And have laid up their >>trea-sures a-bove;
Tongue can >>nev-er ex->>press
The sweet >>com-fort and peace,
Of a soul in its ear-ly-est love.

That sweet >>com-fort was mine
When the >>fa-vor di-vine,
I first found in the blood of the Lamb;
When at first I be-lieved,
What true joy I re-ceived,
What a >>ha-ven in Je-sus’ sweet name.

’Twas a >>heav-en be-low,
My re-deem-er to know,
And the >>an-gels could do >>noth-ing more;
Than to fall at His feet
And the >>sto-ry re->>peat
And the >>lov-er of >>sin-ners a-dore.
