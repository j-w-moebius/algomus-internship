Where are the >>He-brew chil-dren?
Safe in the >>prom-ised land.
Though the >>fur-nace flamed a->>round them,
God, while in their trou-bles, found them;
He with love and >>mer-cy bound them,
Safe in the >>prom-ised land.

Where are the twelve apos-tles?
Safe in the >>prom-ised land.
They went up through pain and sigh-ing,
Scoffing, scourging, cru-ci-fy-ing,
>>no-ble for their >>mas-ter dy-ing,
Safe in the >>prom-ised land.

Where are the >>ho-ly Chris-tians?
Safe in the >>prom-ised land.
Those whoâ€™ve washed their robes and made them
White and >>spot-less pure and laid them
Where no >>earth-ly stain can fade them,
Safe in the >>prom-ised land.
