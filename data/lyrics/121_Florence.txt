Not >>man-y years their rounds shall roll,
Each >>mo-ment brings it nigh,
Ere all its glo-ry-es stand re-veal-ed,
To our ad->>mir-ing eye.
Ye wheels of >>na-ture speed your course,
Ye >>mor-tal pow’rs, de-cay;
Fast as ye bring the night of death,
Ye bring eter->>nal day.

Ye wea-ry, heav-y-lad-en souls,
Who are op->>pressed and sore,
Ye trav’lers through the >>wil-der-ness
To Ca-naan’s >>peace-ful shore.
Though >>chill-ing winds and >>beat-ing rains,
The >>Wa-ters deep and cold,
And en-e-my-es sur->>round-ing you,
Take >>cour-age and be bold.

Though storms and >>hur-ri->canes a-rise,
The >>des-ert all a-round,
And >>fi-ery >>ser-pents oft ap-pear,
Through the en->>chant-ed ground.
Dark nights and clouds and >>gloom-y fear —
And >>drag-ons >>of-ten roar —
But while the >>gos-pel trump we hear,
We’ll press for Ca-naan’s shore.
