The time is soon com-ing, by the >>Proph-ets fore-tell,
When >>Zi-on in >>pu-ri-ty the world shall be-hold.
When Je-susâ€™ pure >>tes-ti->mo-ny will gain the day,
de-nom-i-na-tions, >>self-ish-ness will >>van-ish a-way.

Let all who would wish to see mil->>len-ni-um be-gin,
Come out and be >>sep-a->rate from >>sin-ners and sin.
As soon as the churches are re->>deem-ed from sin,
The day of the mil->>len-ni-um will >>sure-ly be-gin.
