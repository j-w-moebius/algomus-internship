“Why, Oh sin-ner, me pro-fane-ng, why,”
Says God, “My >>stat-utes name;
Why my cov’nant grace dis-dain-ing,
Still my cov’nant grace pro-claim!
Hating coun-sel,
All my laws ex->>posed to shame.

Long in >>si-lence I have waited,
Long thy guilt in >>se-cret grown;
Still, thy heart, with pride elat-ed,
Thought my >>coun-sels like thy own.
I’ll re-prove thee,
Till thy crimes ex->>act are known,

sin-ners, hear Je->>ho-vah speak-ing!
Ye who >>thought-less God de-spise!
Hear, lest in His wrath awaking,
>>ven-geance rend you as it flies.
None can save you,
If His arm to >>judg-ment rise.
