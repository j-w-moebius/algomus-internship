Je-sus, Thou art the sin-nerâ€™s friend,
As such I look to Thee,
Now in the >>bow-els of Thy love,
Oh Lord, re->>mem-ber me.

re->>mem-ber the pure word of grace,
re->>mem-ber cal-va-ry,
re->>mem-ber all Thy >>dy-ing groans,
And then re->>mem-ber me.

Thou >>won-drous >>ad-vo-cate with God,
I yield >my->>self to Thee,
While Thou art >>sit-ting on Thy throne,
Oh Lord, re->>mem-ber me.

And when I close my eyes in death,
And >>crea-ture helps all flee,
Then, Oh my great re-deem-er, God,
I pray re->>mem-ber me.
