I’ve >>learn-ed to sing a glad, new song
Of praise >>un-to our King!
And now with all my ran-som-ed pow’rs
His praises I will sing.
I’ve >>learn-ed to sing the song of peace,
’Tis sweeter ev’ry day,
Since >>Je-sus calmed my >>trou-bled soul,
And bore my sins a-way.

I’ve >>learn-ed to sing the song of joy,
My cup is >>run-ning o’er
With >>bless-ings full of peace and love,
And still there’s more and more.
Soon I shall sing the glad, new song
Of >>Mo-ses and the Lamb,
With all the >>saint-ed hosts a-bove,
be->>fore the great I Am.
