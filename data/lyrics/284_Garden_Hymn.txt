The Lord >>in-to His >>gar-den comes,
The spices yield a rich per-fume,
The lilies grow and thrive;
re->>fresh-ing show’rs of grace di-vine,
From >>Je-sus flow to ev’ry vine,
And make the dead re-vive.

Come, breth-ren, you who love the Lord,
Who taste the >>sweet-ness of His word,
In Je-sus’ word go on;
Our >>trou-bles and our >>tri-als here
Will >>on-ly make us richer there
When we ar->>rive at home.
