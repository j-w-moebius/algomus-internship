amaz->>ing grace! how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind but now I see.

â€™Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears re-lieved;
How >>pre-cious did that grace ap->>pear
The hour I first be-lieved.

Through >>man-y dan-gers, toils and snares,
I have al->>ready come;
â€™Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has >>prom-ised good to me,
His word my hope se-cures;
He will my shield and >>por-tion be
As long as life en-dures.

The earth shall soon dis->>solve like snow,
The sun for-bear to shine;
But God, who called me here be-low,
Will be for->>ev-er mine.
