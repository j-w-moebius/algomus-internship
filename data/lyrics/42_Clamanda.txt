Say, now ye >>love-ly >>so-cial band,
Who walk the way to Ca-naan’s land;
Ye who have fled from Sod-om’s plain,
Say do you wish to turn a-gain?

Oh have you >>ven-tured to the field,
Well armed with hel-met, sword and shield?
And shall the world, with dread alarms,
com->>pel you now to ground your arms?
