What shall I do, shall I lay down
And sink in deep de-spair?
Will He for->>ev-er wear a frown
Nor hear my >>fee-ble pray-er?
No, He will put His strength in me;
He knows the way I’ve strolled;
And when I’m tried suf-fi-cient-ly,
I shall come forth as gold.

When I can read my >>ti-tle clear
To >>man-sions in the skies,
I’ll bid >fare->>well to ev’ry fear,
And wipe my >>weep-ing eyes.
When we’ve been there ten >>thou-sand years,
Bright >>shin-ing as the sun;
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first be-gin.
