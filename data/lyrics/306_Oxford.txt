shep-herds, re-joice! lift up your eyes,
And send your fears a-way:
News from the >>re-gion of the skies —
A sav-ior’s born to-day!
Je-sus, the God whom >>an-gels fear,
Comes down to dwell with you…
to->>day He makes His >>en-trance here,
But not as >>mon->archs do.

No gold nor >>pur-ple swad-dle-ng bands,
Nor >>roy-al >>shin-ing things,
A >>man-ger for His >>cra-dle stands,
And holds the King of kings.
Go, shep-herds, where the >>in-fant lies,
And see His >>hum-ble throne,
With tears of joy in all your eyes,
Go shep-herds, kiss the Son.
