re->>li-gion is the chief con->>cern
Of >>mor-tals here be-low.
May I its great >im->>por-tance learn,
Its >>sov-er-eign >>vir-tues know.
More >>need-ful this than glitt’ring wealth
Or aught the world be-stows;
Nor rep-u-ta-tion, food, or health
Can give us such re-pose.

re->>li-gion should our thoughts en->>gage
a->>midst our >>youth-ful bloom;
’Twill fit us for de->>clin-ing age
And for the >>aw-ful tomb.
Oh may my heart, by grace re-new-ed,
Be my re-deem-er’s throne,
And be my >>stub-born will sub-dued,
His >>gov-ern-ment to own.

Let deep re-pen-tance, faith, and love,
Be joined with >>god-ly fear;
And all my >con-ver->>sa-tion prove
My heart to be sin-cere.
pre->>serve me from the snares of sin
Through my re->>main-ing days,
And in me let each >>vir-tue shine,
To my re-deem-er’s praise.
