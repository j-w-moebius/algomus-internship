In the cross of Christ I glo-ry,
Tow’ring o’er the wrecks of time;
All the light of >>sa-cred sto-ry,
>>gath-ers ’round its head sub-lime.

When the woes of life o’ertake me,
Hopes de->>ceive and fears an-noy;
>>nev-er shall the cross for->>sake me,
Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

When the sun of bliss is >>beam-ing
Light and love up->>on my way;
From the cross the >>ra->di-ance >>stream-ing
Adds more >>lus-ter to the day.

Bane and bless-ing, pain and plea-sure,
By the cross are sat-is-fied;
Peace is there that knows no mea-sure,
Joys that from all time a-bide.
