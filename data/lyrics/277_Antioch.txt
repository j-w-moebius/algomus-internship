Shout on, pray on, we’re gaining ground,
>>glo-ry hal-le-lu-jah!
The dead’s a-live, and the lost is found,
>>glo-ry hal-le-lu-jah!

He lives to bless me with His love;
>>glo-ry hal-le-lu-jah!
He lives to plead my cause a-bove;
>>glo-ry hal-le-lu-jah!

He lives to crush the fiends of hell;
>>glo-ry hal-le-lu-jah!
He lives and doth with->>in me dwell;
>>glo-ry hal-le-lu-jah!
