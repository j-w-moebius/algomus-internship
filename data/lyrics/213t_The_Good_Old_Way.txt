Lift up your heads, Im-man-u-el’s friends,
Oh hal-le-lu-jah,
And taste the >>plea-sure >>Je-sus sends.
Oh hal-le-lu-jah.
Let >>noth-ing cause you to de-lay,
Oh hal-le-lu-jah.
But >>has-ten on the good old way,
Oh hal-le-lu-jah.

Our con->>flicts here, though great they be,
Oh hal-le-lu-jah.
Shall not pre->>vent our vic-to-ry,
Oh hal-le-lu-jah.
If we but strive and watch and pray,
Oh hal-le-lu-jah.
Like >>sol-diers in the good old way.
Oh hal-le-lu-jah.

Though >>Sa-tan may his pow’rs em-ploy,
Oh hal-le-lu-jah.
Our >>hap-pi-ness for to de-stroy.
Oh hal-le-lu-jah.
Yet >>nev-er fear, we’ll gain the day,
Oh hal-le-lu-jah.
And shout and sing the good old way.
Oh hal-le-lu-jah.
