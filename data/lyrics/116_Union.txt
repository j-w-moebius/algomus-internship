Come, >>broth-ers and >>sis-ters who love one an-oth-er,
And have done with years that are gone;
How >>of-ten we’ve met Him in sweet heav’nly un-ion,
Which opens the way to God’s throne.
With joy and >thanks->>giv-ing we’ll praise Him who loved us,
While we run the bright, >>shin-ing way;
Though we part here in bod-y, we’re bound for one glo-ry,
And bound for each >>oth-er to pray.

There was >>Josh->ua and jo-seph, Eli->>as and Mo-ses,
That prayed, and God heard from His throne.
There was >>Abra-ham and Isaac, and >>Ja-cob and Da-vid,
And >>Sol-o-mon and >>Ste-phen and John.
There was >>Sim-e-on and an-na, and I don’t know how man-y,
That prayed as they >>jour-ney-ed a-long;
Some cast a->>mong li-ons, some bound with rough irons,
Yet >>glo-ry and praises they sung.

Some tell us that pray-ing, and >>al-so that praising
Is >>la-bor that’s all spent in vain;
But we have such as >>wit-ness that God hears with swift-ness,
From >>pray-ing we will not re-frain.
There was old >>fa-ther No-ah, and ten >>thou-sand more,
That >>wit-ness-ed that God heard them pray;
There was >>Sam-u-el and Hannah, Paul, Silas, and pe-ter,
And >>Dan-iel and Jo-nah, we’ll say.
