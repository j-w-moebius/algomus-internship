There is a land of pure de-light,
Where saints >im->>mor-tal reign,
>>in-fi-nite day ex->>cludes the night,
And >>plea-sures >>ban-ish pain.
Sweet fields be->>yond the >>swell-ing flood,
Stand dressed in >>liv-ing green,
So to the Jews old >>Ca-naan stood,
While >>Jor-dan rolled be-tween.

Oh could we make our doubts re-move,
Those >>gloom-y doubts that rise,
And see the >>Ca-naan that we love
With un-beclouded eyes.
Could we but climb where >>Mo-ses stood,
And view the >>land->scape o’er,
Not Jor-dan’s stream, nor death’s cold flood
Should fright us from the shore.
