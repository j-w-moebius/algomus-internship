And let this >>fee-ble >>bod-y fail,
And let it faint or die;
My soul shall quit this >>mourn-ful vale,
And soar to worlds on high,

cho-rus:

And I’ll sing hal-le-lu-jah,
And you’ll sing hal-le-lu-jah,
And we’ll all sing hal-le-lu-jah,
When we ar->>rive at home.

Shall join the dis-em-body-ed saints,
And find its long-sought rest,
The >>on-ly bliss for which it pants,
In my re-deem-er’s breast.

(cho-rus)

Oh what are all my suff’rings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that en->>rap-tured host t’ap-pear,
And >>wor-ship at Thy feet!

(cho-rus)

Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,
Take life or friends a-way,
But let me find them all a-gain,
In that eter->>nal day.
