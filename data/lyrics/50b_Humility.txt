Lord, we come be->>fore Thee now,
At Thy feet we >>hum-ble bow;
Oh do not our suit dis-dain!
Shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain?

In Thine own ap->>point-ed way,
Now we seek Thee, here we stay;
Lord from hence we would not go,
Till a >>bless-ing Thou be-stow.

Grant that all may seek and find
Thee a God su->>preme-ly kind;
Heal the sick, the >>cap-tive free.
Let us all re->>joice in Thee.
