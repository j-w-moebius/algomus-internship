See how the >>scrip-tures are ful-fill-ing,
Poor >>sin-ners are re->>turn-ing home,
The time that >>Proph-ets were fore-tell-ing,
With signs and >>won-ders now is come.
The >>gos-pel >>trum-pets now are blowing
From sea to sea, from land to land;
God’s >>ho-ly >>spir-it down is pouring,
And >>Chris-tians >>join-ing heart and hand.

Ten >>thou-sand fall be->>fore Je-ho-vah,
For mer-cy, mer-cy! loud they cry;
They rise, all shout-ing, “hal-le-lu-jah!”
And “glo-ry be to God on high.”
But >>man-y cry, “It’s all dis-or-der,”
And dis-be->>lieve God’s >>ho-ly word;
Yet >>Chris-tians sing and shout the louder,
“All glo-ry, >>glo-ry to the Lord.”
