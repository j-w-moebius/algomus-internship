Be kind to thy fa-ther, for when thou wert young,
Who loved thee so >>fond-ly as he?
He caught the first ac->>cent that fell from thy tongue,
And joined in thy >>in-no-cent glee.

Be kind to thy fa-ther, for now he is old,
His locks >in-ter->>min-gled with gray;
His >>foot->steps are fee-ble, once >>fear-less and bold,
Thy >>fa-ther is >>pass-ing a-way.
