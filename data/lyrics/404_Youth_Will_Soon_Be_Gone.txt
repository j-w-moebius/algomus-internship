Youth, like the spring, will soon be gone,
By >>fleet-ing time or conqu’ring death;
Your >>morn-ing sun may set at noon,
And leave you >>ev-er in the dark.
Your spar-kle-ng eyes and >>glow-ing cheeks
Must >>with-er like the >>blast-ed ro-sé;
The cof-fin, earth, and >>wind-ing sheet
Will soon your >>ac-tive limbs en-close.

Ye heed-less ones who >>wild-ly stroll,
The >>gra-ve will soon be->>come your bed,
Where >>si-lence reigns and >>va-pors roll,
In >>sol-emn >>dark-ness ’round your head.
Your friends will pass the >>lone-some place,
And with a sigh move >>slow-ly on,
Still gazing on the spires of grass
With which your graves are over-grown.

Ye >>bloom-ing youth, this is the state
Of all who do free grace re-fuse;
And soon with you ’twill be too late
The way of life and Christ to choose.
Come lay your >>car-nal >>weap-ons by,
No >>long-er fight a->>gainst your God;
But with the >>gos-pel now com-ply,
And heav’n shall be your great re-ward.
