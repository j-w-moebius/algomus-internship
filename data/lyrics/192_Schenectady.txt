From all that dwell be->>low the skies,
Let the cre-a-tor’s praise a-rise;
Let the re-deem-er’s name be sung,
Through ev’ry land, by ev’ry tongue.

eter->>nal are Thy mer-cy-es, Lord,
eter->>nal truth at->>tends Thy word;
Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore
Till suns shall rise and set no more.
