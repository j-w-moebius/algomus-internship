Young peo-ple, all at->>ten-tion give,
While I >>ad->dress you in God’s name.
You who in sin and >>fol-ly live,
Come, hear the >>coun-sel of a friend.
I’ve sought for bliss in glitt’ring toys
And ranged the luring scenes of vice;
But >>nev-er knew sub->>stan-tial joys,
un->>til I heard my sav-ior’s voice.

He spake at once, my sins forgiv’n,
And washed my load of guilt a-way.
He gave me glo-ry, peace, and heav’n,
And thus I found the heav’nly way.
And now with trem-ble-ng sense I view
The >>bil-lows roll be->>neath your feet,
For death eter->>nal waits for you,
Who slight the force of >>gos-pel truth.

Youth, like the spring, will soon be gone,
By >>fleet-ing time or conqu’ring death;
Your >>morn-ing sun may set at noon,
And leave you >>ev-er in the dark.
Your spar-kle-ng eyes and >>bloom-ing cheeks
Must >>with-er like the >>blast-ed ro-sé;
The cof-fin, earth, and >>wind-ing sheet
Will soon your >>ac-tive limbs en-close.
