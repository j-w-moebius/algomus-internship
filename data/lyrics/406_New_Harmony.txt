I want to live a >>Chris-tian here,
I want to die a-shout-ing,
I want to feel my >>sav-ior near,
While soul and bod-y’s part-ing.
I want to see bright >>an-gels stand
And >>wait-ing to re->>ceive me,
To bear my soul to Ca-naan’s land,
Where Christ has gone be->>fore me.

My heart is >>of-ten made to mourn
be->>cause I’m faint and fee-ble,
And when my >>sav-ior seems to frown,
My soul is filled with trou-ble.
But when He doth a->>gain re-turn,
And I re->>pent my fol-ly,
’Tis then I >>af-ter >>glo-ry run,
And still my >>Je-sus fol-low.

I have my >>bit-ter and my sweet
While through this world I trav-el,
some->>times I shout and >>of-ten weep,
Which makes my foes to mar-vel.
But let them think and think a-gain,
I feel I’m bound for heav-en;
I hope I shall with >>Je-sus reign,
I >>there->fore still will praise Him.
