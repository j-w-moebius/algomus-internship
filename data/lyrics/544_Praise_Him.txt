I’ll praise Him while He gives me breath,
I long to praise Him >>af-ter death.
I’ll praise Him when I’m called to die,
And shout sal->>va-tion when I die.

Time soon shall stop my >>fleet-ing breath,
And in His arms re->>signed to death,
My trem-ble-ng soul to all can tell
That >>Je-sus do-eth all things well.

Then I shall see Him face to face,
And praise Him in that >>ho-ly place.
My theme Through all eter->>ni-ty
Shall glo-ry, glo-ry, >>glo-ry be.
