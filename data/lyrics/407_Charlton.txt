My span of life will soon be gone
The >>pass-ing >>mo-ments say;
As length’ning >>shad->ows o’er the mead
pro->>claim the close of day.
Oh, that my heart might dwell a->>loof
From all cre->>ated things,
And learn that >>wis-dom from a->>bove
Whence true con->>tent-ment springs.

Ere first I drew this >>vi-tal breath,
From na-ture’s >>pris-on free,
Crosses in num-ber, mea-sure, weight,
Were writ-ten, Lord, for me.
But Thou my shep-herd, Friend, and Guide,
Hast >>kind-ly led me on,
Taught me to rest my >>faint-ing head
On Christ, the cor-ner-stone.
