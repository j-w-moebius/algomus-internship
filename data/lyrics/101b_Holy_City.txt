There is a >>ho-ly cit-y,
A >>hap-py world a-bove,
be->>yond the >>star->ry re-gions,
Built by the God of love.
An >ev-er->>last-ing tem-ple,
And saints ar->>ray-ed in white;
They serve their great re-deem-er,
And dwell with Him in light.

It is no world of trou-ble,
The God of peace is there,
He wipes a->>way their sor-rows,
He ban-ish-es their care;
Their joys are still in-crease-ng,
Their songs are >>ev-er new;
They praise th’eter-nal fa-ther,
The Son and spir-it, too.

Is this the Man of >>sor-rows
Who stood at Pi-late’s bar,
con-temn-ed by >>haugh-ty Her-od,
And by his men of war?
He seems a >>might-y conqu’ror,
Who spoiled the pow’rs be-low,
And ran-som-ed >>man-y >>cap-tives
From >ev-er->>last-ing woe.
