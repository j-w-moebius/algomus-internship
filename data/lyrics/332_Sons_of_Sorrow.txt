Hail ye >>sigh-ing sons of sor-row;
Learn with me, your >>cer-tain doom
Learn with me your fate to->>mor->row —
Dead, per-haps, laid in the tomb!
See all >>na-ture fad-ing, dy-ing,
si-lent, all things seem to mourn;
Life from >veg-e->>ta-tion fly-ing,
Calls to mind the mould’ring urn.

Oft the >>au-tumn >>tem-pest ris-ing,
Makes the >>loft-y >>for-est nod;
Scenes of na-ture, how sur-pris-ing,
Read in na-ture, na-ture’s God.
And our sov’reign sole cre->>a-tor
Lives eter->>nal in the sky,
While we >>mor-tals yield to na-ture,
Bloom a-while, then fade and die.

Fast my sun of life’s de-clin-ing,
Soon ’twill set in >>dis-mal night;
But in my hopes, pure and re-fine-ng,
Rest in >>fu-ture life and light.
Cease then trem-ble-ng, fearing, sigh-ing,
Death will break the >>sul-len gloom;
Soon my spir-it, flutt’ring, fly-ing,
Shall be borne be->>yond the tomb.
