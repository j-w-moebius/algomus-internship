Why should we start and fear to die?
What timâ€™rous worms we >>mor-tals are!
Death is the gate of >>end-less joy,
And yet we dread to >>en-ter there.

cho-rus:

Roll on, sweet mo-ments, roll on,
And let the poor >>pil-grim go home.

O if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul would stretch her wings in haste;
Fly >>fear-less through deathâ€™s >>i-ron gate,
Nor feel the >>ter-rors as she passed.
