Well may Thy >>ser-vants mourn, my God,
The Church’s des-o-la-tion;
The state of >>Zi-on calls a->>loud
For grief and lam-en-ta-tion.
Once she was all a->>live to Thee
And >>thou-sands were con-vert-ed,
But now a sad re->>verse we see,
Her >>glo-ry is de-part-ed.

And has re->>li-gion left the Church
with->>out a trace be->>hind her?
Where shall I go, where shall I search,
That I once more may find her?
a-dieu, ye proud, ye light and gay,
I’ll seek the bro-ken-heart-ed,
Who weep when they of >>Zi-on say,
Her >>glo-ry is de-part-ed.

Some few, like good Eli->>jah stand,
While >>thou-sands have re-volt-ed,
In >>ear-nest for the heav’nly land
They >>nev-er yet have halted.
With such re->>li-gion doth re-main,
For they are not per-vert-ed;
Oh may they all through men re->>gain
The >>glo-ry that’s de-part-ed.
