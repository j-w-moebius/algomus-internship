Je-sus, my shep-herd, Friend, and Guide
Can dry my ev’ry tear;
Thy grace can raise my >>com-forts high
And >>ban-ish ev’ry fear;
Thy grace, how sweet the sound to me,
Thou art my all in all.

Dear fa-ther, to Thy >>mer-cy seat,
My soul for >>shel-ter flies;
’Tis here I find a safe re->>treat
When storms and >>tem-pest rise;
He lives to bless me with His love,
And plead my cause a-bove.
