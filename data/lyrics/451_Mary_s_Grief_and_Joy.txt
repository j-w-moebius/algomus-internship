>>Mar-y to her sav-ior’s tomb
Hasted at the >>ear-ly dawn;
Spice she brought and sweet per-fume,
But the Lord she loved was gone.

For a->>while she >>weep-ing stood,
Struck with >>sor-row and sur-prise;
>>shed-ding tears, a plen-te-ous flood,
For her heart sup-ply-ed her eyes.

Oh, my sav-ior, oh, my sav-ior,
Where has my >>sav-ior gone?
Oh, my sav-ior, here’s my sav-ior,
He has >>ris-en from the tomb.
