Hark! the >>her-ald >>an-gels sing,
“glo-ry to the >>new-born King;
Peace on earth, and >>mer-cy mild,
God and >>sin-ners rec-on-ciled!”

See, He lays His >>glo-ry by;
Born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth;
Born to give them >>sec-ond birth.

Hail, the >>ho-ly Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of righ-teous-ness;
Light and life to all He brings,
Ris’n with >>heal-ing in His wings.

Let us all then with >>an-gels sing,
“glo-ry to the >>new-born King!
Peace on earth and >>mer-cy mild,
God and >>sin-ners rec-on-ciled!”
