My days on earth are >>al->most gone,
The things I want can not be won;
It is the Lord that >>free-ly gives,
It’s where He lives I want to live.

It is one thing I >>sure-ly know,
It is to heav’n I want to go
To sing His praise where >>an-gels sing,
To praise my Lord and >>sav-ior King.

My life has been to sing God’s praise
In hope of the eter->>nal days;
I mean to do the best I can
And meet you in the >>prom-ised land.

My friends have been so good to me,
And where you go I want to be;
My love for you no tongue can tell,
Dear >>lov-ing friends, so fare you well.
