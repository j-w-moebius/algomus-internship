Come, we who love the Lord,
And let our joys be known:
Join in a song with sweet ac->>cord
And thus sur->>round the throne.

Let those re->>fuse to sing
Who >>nev-er knew our God;
But >>ser-vants of the heavâ€™nly King
May speak their joys a-broad.

The God that rules on high,
That all the earth sur-veys,
That rides up->>on the >>storm-y sky,
And calms the >>roar-ing sea.
