And if you meet with >>trou-bles
And >>tri-als on the way,
Then cast your care on Je-sus,
And don’t for->>get to pray.
Gird on the heav’nly >>ar-mor
Of faith, and hope, and love;
And when the com-bat’s ended,
He’ll take you up a-bove.

Through grace I am de->>ter-mined
To con-quer, though I die;
And then a->>way to >>Je-sus
On wings of love I’ll fly;
>fare->>well to sin and sor-row,
I bid you all a-dieu,
Then, O my friends, prove faith-ful,
And on your way pur-sue.
