Come, let us join with one ac-cord,
In hymns a->>round the throne;
This is the day our >>ris-en Lord
Hath made and called His own.

cho-rus:

Then let us in His name sing on,
And >>has-ten that great day;
When our re-deem-er shall come down,
And >>shad->ows pass a-way.

This is the day which God hath blest,
The brightest of the sev’n;
A type of >ev-er->>last-ing rest,
That saints >en->>joy in heav’n.
