Lord, I >>can-not let Thee go,
Till a >>bless-ing Thou be-stow:
Do not turn a->>way Thy face,
Mine’s an ur-gent, >>press-ing case.

Dost Thou ask me who I am?
Ah, my Lord, Thou know’st my name:
Yet the >>ques-tion gives a plea
To sup->>port my suit with Thee.

Thou didst once a wretch be-hold,
In re->>bel-lion >>blind-ly bold,
Scorn Thy grace, Thy pow’r de-fy;
That poor reb-el, Lord, was I.
