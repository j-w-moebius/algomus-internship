Our >>bond-age it shall end
By and by,
From Egypt’s yoke set free;
Hail the >>glo-ri-ous ju-bi-lee,
And to >>Ca-naan we’ll re-turn,
By and by.

Our de->>liv-er He shall come
By and by,
And our >>sor-rows have an end,
With our three score years and ten,
And vast >>glo-ry crown the day
By and by.

Though our en-e-my-es are strong,
We’ll go on,
Though our hearts dis->>solve with fear,
Lo, Si-nai’s God is near,
While the >>fi-ery >>pil-lar moves,
We’ll go on.
