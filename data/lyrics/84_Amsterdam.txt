Rise my soul and stretch thy wings,
Thy >>bet-ter >>por-tion trace,
Rise from all ter->>res-tri-al things
T’wards heav-en, thy >>na-tive place.

Sun and moon and stars de-cay;
Time shall soon this earth re-move;
Rise, my soul, and haste a->>way
To seats pre->>pared a-bove.

>>Riv-ers to the >>o-cean run,
Nor stay in all their course;
Fire, as-cend-ing, seeks the sun;
Both speed them to their source;

So a soul that’s born of God
Pants to view His >>glo-ri-ous face,
>>up-wards tends to His a->>bode
To rest in His em-brace.
