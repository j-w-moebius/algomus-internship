Thou art gone to the gra-ve, but we will not de->>plore thee,
Tho’ >>sor-rows and >>dark-ness en->>com-pass the tomb;
The >>sav-ior has passed thro’ its >>por-tals be->>fore thee,
And the lamp of His love is thy guide thro’ the gloom.

Thou art gone to the gra-ve, we no >>long-er be->>hold thee,
Nor tread the rough paths of the world by thy side;
But wide arms of >>mer-cy are spread to en->>fold thee,
And all >>sin-ners may hope, since the >>sav-ior hath died.

Thou art gone to the gra-ve, and thy cra-dle’s for-saken,
With us thy fond >>spir-it did not >>tar-ry long,
But >>sun->shine of >>heav-en beamed bright on thy wak-ing,
And the sound thou didst hear was the ser-a-phim’s song.

Thou art gone to the gra-ve, but ’twere wrong to de->>plore thee,
When God was thy ran-som, and >>guard-ian and guide;
He gave thee, and took thee, and soon will re->>store thee,
Where death hath no sting, since the >>sav-ior hath died.
