There is a >>foun-tain filled with blood,
Drawn from Im-man-u-el’s veins;
And >>sin-ners plunged be->>neath that flood,
Lose all their >>guilt-y stains.
The >>dy-ing thief re->>joiced to see
That >>foun-tain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins a-way.

E’er since by faith I saw the stream,
Thy >>flow-ing wounds sup-ply;
re->>deem-ing love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.
Then in a no-bler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy pow’r to save,
When this poor lisping, stamm’ring tongue
Lies >>si-lent in the gra-ve.
