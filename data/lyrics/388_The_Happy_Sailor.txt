She’s the old ship of Zi-on, hallelu!
And her cap-tain, Ju-dah’s li-on, hal-le-lu-jah.

Oh, tell me, >>hap-py sail-or!
And will she leave >>oth-er >>com->rades on board?
Oh, tell me, >>hap-py sail-or!

She will land us safe on Ca-naan’s bright shore,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
We’ll land with our friends, who’ve gone on be-fore,
Oh, glo-ry, hal-le-lu-jah!
