God of my life, look >>gen-tle down,
be->>hold the pains I feel;
But I am dumb be->>fore Thy throne,
Nor dare dis->>pute Thy will.

I’m but a >>so-journ-er be-low,
As all my >>fa-thers were;
May I be well pre->>pared to go
When I the >>sum-mons hear.

But if my life be spared a-while,
be->>fore my last re-move,
Thy praise shall be my bus’ness still
And I’ll de->>clare Thy love.
