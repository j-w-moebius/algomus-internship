In those days came John the bap-tist,
>>preach-ing in the >>wil-der-ness of Ju-daea,
And say-ing, re->>pent ye,
For the >>king-dom of >>heav-en is at hand,
For this is He that was >>spo-ken of
By the >>proph-et Esaias, say-ing,
The voice of one >>cry-ing in the wil-der-ness,
pre->>pare ye the way of the Lord,
Make His paths straight,
And this same John had his rai-ment of cam-elâ€™s hair
And bound with a leath-ern gir-dle;
And his meat was >>lo-custs and wild hon-ey.
