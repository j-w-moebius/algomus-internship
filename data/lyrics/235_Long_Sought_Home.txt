Je-ru-sa-lem! my >>hap-py home!
Oh, how I long for thee!
When will my >>sor-rows have an end?
Thy joys when shall I see?

cho-rus:

Home, sweet home, my long-sought home,
My home in heav’n a-bove.

Thy walls are all of >>pre-cious stones,
Most >>glo-ri-ous to be-hold!
Thy gates are >>rich-ly set with pearl,
Thy streets are pa-véd with gold.

(cho-rus)

My friends, I bid you all a-dieu;
I leave you in God’s care;
And if I here no more see you,
Go on; I’ll meet you there.

(cho-rus)
