>>Je-sus left His home on high,
Oh, what love, what >>won-drous love!
And for >>sin-ners came to die, what love.
Bled and died on cal-va-ry,
All be->>cause of you and me,
Oh, what love, what >>won-der-ful love.
It was love He had for me,
Caused my blinded eyes to see,
Oh, what love, oh what >>won-drous love!

>>hap-pi-ness and joy I’ve found,
For I’m on much higher ground,
You can share a->>long the way of love.
For my >>sav-ior made the way,
>>lead-ing to a brighter day,
Oh, what love, oh, yes, what >>won-drous love.
I can shout, and I can sing,
Make His praises >>glad-ly ring,
Oh, what love, oh what >>won-drous love!
