Let the high heav’ns your songs in-vite,
These >>spa-cious fields of >>bril-liant light,
Where sun and moon and >>plan-ets roll,
And stars that glow from pole to pole.

Sun, moon, and stars con->>vey Thy praise
’Round the whole earth and >>nev-er stand,
So when Thy truth be->>gin its race,
It touched and glanced on ev’ry hand.
