Ye >>ob-jects of sense and en->>joy-ments of time,
Which oft have de->>light-ed my heart,
I soon shall ex->>change you for views more sub-lime,
For joys that shall >>nev-er de-part.

Thou, Lord of the day, and thou, Queen of the night,
To me ye no >>long-er are known;
I soon shall be-hold, with in-crease-ng de-light,
A sun that shall >>nev-er go down.

Ye >>moun-tains and val-leys, groves, Riv-ers, and plains,
Thou earth and thou o-cean, a-dieu;
More >>per-ma-nent >>re-gions where >>righ-teous-ness reigns,
>>pres-ent their bright hills to my view.
