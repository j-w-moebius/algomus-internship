be->>hold the love, the gen’rous love
That >>ho-ly >>Da-vid shows!
be->>hold his kind com->>pas-sion move
For his af->>flict-ed foes!
When they are sick, his soul com-plains,
And seems to feel the smart;
The >>spir-it of the >>gos-pel reigns,
And melts his >>pi-ous heart.

How did his >>flow-ing tears con-dole
As for a >>broth-er dead!
And fasting, >>mor-ti->fied his soul,
While for their lives He prayed.
They groaned and cursed Him on their bed,
Yet still He pleads and mourns;
And >>dou-ble >>bless-ings on his head
The >>righ-teous Lord re-turns.

Oh >>glo-ri-ous type of heav’nly grace!
Thus Christ the Lord ap-pears;
While >>sin-ners curse, the >>sav-ior prays,
And pities them with tears.
He the true Da-vid, Is-ra-el’s King,
>>bless-ed and loved of God,
To save us >>reb-els dead in sin,
Paid His own dearest blood.
