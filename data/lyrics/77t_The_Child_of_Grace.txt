How hap-py’s ev’ry child of grace,
Who feels his sins forgiv’n;
This world, he cries, is not my place;
I seek a place in heav’n.
A >>coun-try far from >>mor-tal sight,
Yet, oh! by faith I see
The land of rest, the saints’ de-light,
A heav’n pre->>pared for me.

Oh, what a >>bless-ed hope is ours
While here on earth we stay,
We more than taste the heav’nly pow’rs
And an-te-date that day.
We feel the >res-ur->>rec-tion near,
Our life in Christ con-cealed,
And with His >>glo-ri-ous >>pres-ence here
Our >>earth-en >>ves-sels filled.
