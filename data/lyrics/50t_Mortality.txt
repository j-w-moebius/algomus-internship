Death, like an >>over-flow->ing stream,
Sweeps us a-way; our life’s a dream,
An >>emp-ty tale, a >>morn-ing flow’r,
Cut down and >>with-er-ed in an hour.

Our age to sev’nty years is set;
How short the time! How frail the state!
And if to >>eight-y we ar-rive,
We’d >>rath-er sigh and groan than live.

Teach us, Oh Lord, how frail is man;
And >>kind-ly >>length-en out the span,
Till a wise care of >>pi-e-ty
Fit us to die and dwell with Thee.
