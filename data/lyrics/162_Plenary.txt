Hark! from the tomb a >>dole-ful sound,
Mine ears, at->>tend the cry,
Ye >>liv-ing men, come view the ground
Where you must >>short-ly lie.

“Princes, this clay must be your bed,
In spite of all your tow’rs;
The tall, the wise, the rev’rend head,
Must lie as low as ours.”

Great God! Is this our >>cer-tain doom?
And are we still se-cure?
Still >>walk-ing >>down-ward to the tomb,
And yet pre->>pared no more!
