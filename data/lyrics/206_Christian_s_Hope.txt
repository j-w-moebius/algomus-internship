We have our >>trou-bles here be-low,
We’re trav’ling through this world of woe,
To that bright world where loved ones go,
Where all is peace and love.

We’re >>fet-ter-ed and chained up in clay
While in this >>bod-y here we stay;
By faith we know a world a-bove,
Where all is peace and love.

I feel no way like >>get-ting tired,
I’m >>trust-ing in His >>ho-ly Word
To guide my >>wea-ry feet a-bove,
Where all is peace and love.
