What >>sol-emn sound the ear in-vades,
What wraps the land in sor-row’s shade?
From heav’n the >>aw-ful >>man->date flies,
The >>fa-ther of his >>coun-try dies.

Where shall our >>na-tion turn its eye,
What help re->>mains be->>neath the sky?
Our friend, pro-tec-tor, strength and trust,
Lies low and mould’ring in the dust.
