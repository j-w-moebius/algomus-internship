And now, my friends, both old and young,
I hope in Christ you’ll still go on;
And if on earth we meet no more,
O may we meet on Ca-naan’s shore.
I hope you’ll all re->>mem-ber me
If you on earth no more I see;
An int’rest in your >>pray-ers I crave,
That we may meet be->>yond the gra-ve.

How oft I’ve seen your >>flow-ing tears
And heard you tell your hopes and fears;
Your hearts with love were seen to flame,
Which makes me hope we’ll meet a-gain.
Ye >>mourn-ing souls, light up your eyes
To glor’ous >>man-sions in the skies;
O trust His grace — in Ca-naan’s land
We’ll no more take the >>part-ing hand.

O glor’ous day, O >>bless-ed hope!
My soul leaps >>for-ward at the thought;
When, on that hap-py, >>hap-py land
We’ll no more take the >>part-ing hand.
But with our >>bless-ed >>ho-ly Lord,
We’ll shout and sing with one ac-cord,
And there we’ll all with >>Je-sus dwell,
So >>lov-ing Chris-tians, fare you well!
