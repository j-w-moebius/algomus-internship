My >>spir-it looks to God a-lone,
My rock and >>ref-uge is His throne;
In all my fears, in all my straits,
My soul on His sal->>va-tion waits.
Trust Him ye saints in all your ways,
Pour out your hearts be->>fore His face;
When >>help-ers fail, and foes in-vade,
God is our all-suf-fi-cient aid.

Make not in-crease-ng gold your trust,
Nor set your hearts on glitt’ring dust;
Why will you grasp the >>fleet-ing smoke,
And not be->>lieve what God hath spoke?
For sov’reign pow’r reign not a-lone,
Grace is the >>part-ner of the throne;
Thy grace and >>jus-tice >>might-y Lord,
Shall well di->>vide our last re-ward.
