Let evâ€™ry >>mor-tal ear at-tend,
And evâ€™ry heart re-joice;
The >>trum-pet of the >>gos-pel sounds,
With an >in->>vit-ing voice.

eter->>nal >>wis-dom has pre->>pared
A soul-re-vive-ng feast;
And bids your >>long-ing >>ap-pe->tites
The rich pro->>vi-sions taste.

Ho! ye that pant for >>liv-ing streams,
And pine a->>way and die;
Here you may quench your >>rag-ing thirst
With springs that >>nev-er dry.
