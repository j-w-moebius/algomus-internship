sal-va-tion, O the >>joy-ful sound!
‘Tis >>plea-sure to our ears;
A sov’reign balm for ev’ry wound,
A >>cor-dial for our fears.

Buried in >>sor-row and in sin,
At hell’s dark door we lay;
But we a->>rise by grace di->>vine
To see a heav’nly day.

sal-va-tion! Let the >>ech-o fly
The >>spa-cious earth a-round;
While all the ar-my-es of the sky
con->>spire to raise the sound.
