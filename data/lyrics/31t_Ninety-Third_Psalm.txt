Grace! ’Tis a >>charm-ing sound,
har->>mo-ni-ous to the ear;
Heav’n with the >>ech-o shall re-sound,
And all the earth shall hear.

Grace first con->>trived the way
To save re->>bel-lious man;
And all the steps that grace dis-play,
Which drew the >>won-drous plan.

Grace taught my wand’ring feet
To tread the heav’nly road;
And new sup-ply-es each hour I meet,
While >>press-ing on to God.

Grace all the work shall crown
Through >ev-er->>last-ing days;
It lays in heav’n the top-most stone,
And well de->>serves our praise.
