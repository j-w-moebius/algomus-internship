Je-sus, my all to heav’n is gone,
He whom I fix my hopes up-on;
His track I see, and I’ll pur->>sue
The >>nar-row way till Him I view.

cho-rus:

I’m on my >>jour-ney home to the new Je-ru-sa-lem,
So fare you well, I am >>go-ing home.

The way the >>ho-ly >>Proph-ets went,
The road that leads from ban-ish-ment,
The King’s >>high->way of >>ho-li-ness
I’ll go, for all His paths are peace.

(cho-rus)

This is the way I long have sought,
And mourned be->>cause I found it not;
My grief a >>bur-den long has been,
be->>cause I was not saved from sin.

(cho-rus)

Then will I tell to >>sin-ners ’round,
What a dear >>sav-ior I have found;
I’ll point to Thy re->>deem-ing blood,
And say, “be-hold the way to God.”

(cho-rus)

Lo! glad I come, and thou, blest Lamb,
Shalt take me to Thee, whose I am;
>>noth-ing but sin have I to give,
>>noth-ing but love shall I re-ceive.

(cho-rus)
