There is a house not made with hands,
eter-nal, and on high;
And here my spir-it, >>wait-ing stands,
Till God shall bid it fly.

cho-rus:

I long to see my friends a->>gain
And hear them >>sweet-ly say;
Come, >>wea-ry dove, here is thy home,
Then fold thy wings and stay.

>>short-ly this >>pris-on of my clay
Must be dis->>solved and fall;
Then, Oh my soul, with joy o->>bey
Thy heav’nly fa-ther’s call.
