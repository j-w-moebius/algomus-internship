I’m not a->>shamed to own my Lord
Or to de->>fend His cause;
main->>tain the >>hon-or of His word,
The >>glo-ry of His cross.
Je-sus, my God! I know His name;
His name is all my trust;
Nor will He put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.

Firm as His throne His >>prom-ise stands
And He can well se->>cure
What I’ve com->>mit-ted to His hands
Till the de->>ci-sive hour.
Then will He own my >>worth-less name
be->>fore His fa-ther’s face,
And in the new Je->>ru-sa-lem
ap->>point my soul a place.
