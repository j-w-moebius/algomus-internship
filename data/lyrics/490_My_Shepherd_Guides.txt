The Lord my >>pre-cious >>shep-herd is,
He guides me day by day,
If I but trust His >>ho-ly word,
In paths of right I’ll stay.
I’ll fear no evil if He leads,
be->>side the >>Wa-ters still,
He anoints my head with oil so sweet,
My cup with joy He fills.

Though I walk through the >>val-ley dark,
No >>shad->ows will be-fall,
Thy rod, Thy staff, they >>com-fort me,
Thou art my God, my all.
>>sure-ly Thy >>good-ness and Thy love,
Thy >>mer-cy free on call,
Will keep me safe from sin and strife,
I’ll praise Thee, Lord of all.
