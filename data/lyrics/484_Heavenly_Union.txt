Come, saints and sin-ners, hear me tell
The >>won-ders of Em-man-u-el,
Who saved me from a >>burn-ing hell,
And brought my soul with Christ to dwell,
And gave me heav’nly un-ion.

When >>Je-sus saw me from on high,
be->>hold my soul in >>ru-in lie,
He looked on me with >>pity-ing eye,
And said to me as He passed by,
“With God you have no un-ion.”

“Oh God, have mer-cy,” then said I,
And looked this way and that to fly;
It grieved me sore that I must die;
I strove sal->>va-tion then to buy,
But still I had no un-ion.

But when de->>pressed and lost in sin,
My dear re-deem-er took me in,
And with His blood He washed me clean,
And O what >>sea-sons I have seen,
Since first I felt this un-ion!
