Come, wand’ring sheep, oh, come!
I’ll bind thee to my breast,
I’ll bear thee to my home,
And lay thee down to rest.

I saw thee stray for-lorn,
And heard thee >>faint-ly cry,
And on the tree of scorn,
For thee I deign to die.

I shield thee from alarms,
And wilt thou not be blest?
I bear thee in my arms;
Thou bear me in thy breast.
