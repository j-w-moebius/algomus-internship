Come, Thou Fount of ev’ry bless-ing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace:
Streams of mer-cy, >>nev-er ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

cho-rus:

There is rest for the wea-ry,
There is rest for you.

Here I’ll raise my eb-e-ne-zer,
>>hith-er by Thy help I’m come.
And I hope, by Thy good plea-sure,
>>safe-ly to ar->>rive at home.

(cho-rus)
