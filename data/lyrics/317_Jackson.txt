I am a >>strang-er here be-low,
And what I am is hard to know,
I am so vile, so prone to sin,
I fear that Iâ€™m not born a-gain.

When I ex->>pe-ri-ence call to mind,
My >un-der->>stand-ing is so blind,
All >>feel-ing sense seems to be gone,
Which makes me think that I am wrong.

I find >my->>self out of the way,
My thoughts are >>of-ten gone a-stray,
Like one a->>lone I seem to be,
Oh, is there >>any-one like me?
