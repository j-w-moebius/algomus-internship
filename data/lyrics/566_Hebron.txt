Thus far the Lord hath led me on,
Thus far His pow’r pro->>longed my days;
And ev’ry ev’ning shall make known
Some fresh me->>mo-ri-als of His grace.

Much of my time has run to waste,
And I, per-haps, am near my home.
But He for->>gives my fol-ly-es past,
And gives me strength for days to come.

I lay my >>bod-y down to sleep,
Peace is the >>pil-low for my head;
While well-ap-point-ed >>an-gels keep
Their >>watch-ful >>sta-tions ’round my bed.
