My >>sav-ior and my King,
Thy beau-ty-es are di-vine;
Thy lips with >>bless-ing over-flow,
And ev’ry grace is Thine.

The smilings of Thy face,
How >>ami-a-ble they are;
’Tis heav’n to rest in Thine em-brace,
And >>no->where else but there.

Nor earth, nor all the sky,
Can one de->>light af-ford;
No, not a drop of Thy >>re-al joy,
with->>out Thy pres-ence, Lord.
