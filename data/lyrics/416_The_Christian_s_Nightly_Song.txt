I’ll sing my sav-ior’s grace,
And His sweet name I’ll praise,
While in this land of >>sor-row I re-main.
My >>sor-rows soon shall end,
And then my soul as-cend,
Where freed from trou-ble, sor-row, sin and pain.

But oh, and shall I then
be->>hold the friend of men,
The man who suf-fer-ed, bled and died for me:
Who bore my load of sin,
And sor-row, grief and pain
To make me >>hap-py and to set me free.
