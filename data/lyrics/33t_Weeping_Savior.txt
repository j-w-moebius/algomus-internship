Did Christ o’er >>sin-ners weep?
And shall our cheeks be dry?
Let floods of pen-i-ten-tial grief
Burst forth from ev’ry eye.

The Son of God in tears
The wond’ring >>an-gels see;
Be thou as-ton-ished, Oh my soul,
He shed those tears for thee.

He wept that we might weep;
Each sin de->>mands a tear;
In heav’n a->>lone no sin is found,
And there’s no >>weep-ing there.
