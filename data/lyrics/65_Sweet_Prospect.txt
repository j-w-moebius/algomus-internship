On Jor-dan’s >>storm-y banks I stand,
And cast a >>wish-ful eye,
To Ca-naan’s fair and >>hap-py land,
Where my pos->>ses-sions lie.

cho-rus:

Oh, the trans-port-ing, rapt’rous scene,
That rises to my sight,
Sweet fields ar->>ray-ed in >>liv-ing green,
And >>Riv-ers of de-light.

O’er all those wide ex->>tend-ed plains,
Shines one eter->>nal day;
There God the Son for->>ev-er reigns,
And scat-ters night a-way.

(cho-rus)

No >>chill-ing winds, or pois’nous breath,
Can reach that >>health-ful shore;
>>sick-ness and sor-row, pain and death,
Are felt and feared no more.
