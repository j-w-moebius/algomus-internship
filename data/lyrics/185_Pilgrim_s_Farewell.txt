fare-well, my friends, I must be gone;
I have no home or stay with you;
I’ll take my staff and >>trav-el on,
Till I a >>bet-ter world can view.

cho-rus:

I’ll march to Ca-naan’s land,
I’ll land on Ca-naan’s shore,
Where >>plea-sures >>nev-er end,
And >>trou-bles come no more.
fare-well, my >>lov-ing friends, fare-well.

fare-well, my friends, time rolls a-long,
Nor waits for >>mor-tal cares or bliss;
I’ll leave you here and >>trav-el on,
Till I ar->>rive where >>Je-sus is.

(cho-rus)

fare-well, dear >>breth-ren in the Lord,
To you I’m bound with cords of love;
But we be->>lieve His >>gra-cious Word,
We all ere long shall meet a-bove.

(cho-rus)
