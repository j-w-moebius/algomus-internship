And let this >>fee-ble >>bod-y fail,
And let it faint or die;
My soul shall quit this >>mourn-ful vale,
And soar to worlds on high.

Shall join the dis-em-body-ed saints,
And find its long-sought rest,
The >>on-ly bliss for which it pants,
In my re-deem-er’s breast.

Oh what are all my suff’rings here,
If, Lord, Thou count me meet
With that en->>rap-tured host t’ap-pear,
And >>wor-ship at Thy feet!
