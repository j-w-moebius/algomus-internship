Nailed to the >>shame-ful tree!
How vast the love that Him in-clined,
To bleed and die for thee.
Hark, how He groans! while >>na-ture shakes,
And earth’s strong >>pil-lars bend!
The tem-ple’s veil in >>sun-der breaks,
The >>sol-id >>mar-bles rend.

’Tis done! the >>pre-cious ran-som’s paid!
re->>ceive my soul, He cries:
See where He bows His >>sa-cred head!
He bows His head and dies.
But soon He’ll break death’s >>anx-ious chain,
And in full >>glo-ry shine!
Oh Lamb of God, was >>ev-er pain,
Was >>ev-er love like Thine?
