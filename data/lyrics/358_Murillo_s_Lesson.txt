As down a lone >>val-ley with >>ce-dars o’erspread,
From war’s dread con->>fu-sion I pen-sive-ly strayed,
The gloom from the face of fair >>heav-en re-tired,
The winds hushed their mur-murs, the >>thun-ders ex-pired.
per->>fumes as of >>E-den flowed >>sweet-ly a-long,
A voice as of >>an-gels en-chant-ing-ly sung,
Co-lum-bia, Co->>lum-bia to >>glo-ry a-rise,
The queen of the world and the child of the skies.

Fair >>sci-ence her gate to thy sons shall un-bar,
And the east see thy morn hide the beams of her star.
New bards and new sages un->>ri-valed shall soar
To fame un-extinguished when time is no more.
To Thee the last >>ref-uge of >>vir-tue de-sign-ed,
Shall fly from all >>na-tions the best of man-kind;
There >>grate-ful to >>heav-en with trans->>port shall bring
To Je-sus, the >>au-thor of >>na-tions will sing.
