Oh, for a heart to praise my God,
A heart from sin set free;
A heart that’s >>sprin-kled with His blood,
So >>free-ly shed for me.
Oh, for a heart sub-mis-sive, meek,
My great re-deem-er’s throne,
Where >>on-ly Christ is heard to speak,
Where >>Je-sus reigns a-lone.

Oh, for an hum-ble, con->>trite heart,
be-lieve-ng, true, and clean,
Which >>nei-ther life nor death can part
From Him that dwells with-in.
A heart in ev’ry thought re-new-ed,
And full of love di-vine;
per-fect, and right, and pure, and good,
A cop-y, Lord, of Thine.
