When the >>mid->night cry be-gin,
Oh what lam-en-ta-tion,

Lo, the >>bride->groom is at hand,

Some, in-deed, did wait a-while,
Shone with->>out a ri-val,
But they spent their >>seem-ing oil,
Long since last re-viv-al.

Oh, when scene was closed,
Now a->>gainst the >>bride->groom fight,
And so they stand op-posed.
