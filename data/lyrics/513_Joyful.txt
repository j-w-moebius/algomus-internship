Am I a >>sol-dier of the >>cross-
A foll’wer of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?
Must I be car-ry-ed to the skies
On flow’ry beds of ease?
While >>oth-ers fought to win the prize,
And sailed through >>blood-y seas?

cho-rus:

Oh, that will be >>joy-ful to meet
To part no more.
On Ca-naan’s >>hap-py shore;
We all shall meet at Je-sus’ feet
With those who’ve gone be-fore.

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?
Sure I must fight if I would reign;
>in->>crease my cour-age, Lord;
I’ll bear the toil, en->>dure the pain,
sup->>port-ed by Thy Word.
