Lord, shed a beam of heavâ€™nly day,
To melt this >>stub-born stone a-way;
And thaw, with rays of love di-vine,
This heart, this >>fro-zen heart of mine.

To hear the >>sor-rows Thou hast felt,
All but an >>ad-a-mant would melt;
>>good-ness and wrath in vain >>com-bine
To move this >>stu-pid heart of mine.

But One can yet per->>form the deed;
That One in all His grace I need;
Thy >>spir-it can from dross re->>fine
And melt this >>stub-born heart of mine.

Oh Breath of life, breathe on my soul!
On me let streams of >>mer-cy roll;
Now thaw with rays of love di->>vine
This heart, this >>fro-zen heart of mine.
