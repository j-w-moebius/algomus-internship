Come, Oh Thou >>trav-el-er un-known,
Whom still I !hold, but >>can-not see;
My >>com-pa->ny be->>fore is gone,
And I am left a->>lone with Thee.
With Thee all !night I mean to stay,
And >>wres-tle till the break of day.

In vain Thou strugglest to get free,
I >>nev-er will un-loose my hold;
Art Thou the !Man that died for me?
The >>se-cret of Thy love un-fold.
wres-tling, I will not let Thee go,
Till I Thy !name, Thy >>na-ture know.
