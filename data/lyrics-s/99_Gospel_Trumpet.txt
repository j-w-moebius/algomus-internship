Hark! How the >>gos-pel >>trum-pet sounds!
Through all the !world the >>ech-o bounds;
And >>Je-sus by re->>deem-ing blood
Is bringing >>sin-ners home to God
And guides them >>safe-ly by His word
To >>end-less day.

Thy blood, dear Je-sus, once was spilt
To save our !souls from sin and guilt,
And >>sin-ners now may come to God
And find sal->>va-tion through Thy blood,
And sail by !faith up->>on that flood
To >>end-less day.
