When Thou, my >>righ-teous Judge, shall come
To take Thy ran-som-ed >>peo-ple home,
Shall I a->>mong them stand?
Shall such a >>worth-less worm as I,
Who some->>times am a->>fraid to die,
Be found at Thy right hand?

I love to meet Thy >>peo-ple now,
be->>fore Thy feet with them to bow,
Though vilest of them all;
But can I bear the >>pierc-ing thought:
What if my !name should be left out
When Thou for them shalt call?

Oh !Lord, pre->>vent it by Thy grace,
Be Thou my >>on-ly >>hid-ing place,
In this ac->>cept-ed day,
Thy pardâ€™ning voice, oh, let me hear
To still my >un-be->>liev-ing fear,
Nor let me !fall, I pray.
