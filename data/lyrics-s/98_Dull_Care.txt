Why should we at our lot com-plain,
Or !grieve at our dis-tress?
Some think if they could >>rich-es gain,
They’d gain true hap-pi-ness.

Ah! we’re much to !blame,
We’re all the same —
a->>like we’re made of clay;
Then, since we have a >>sav-ior dear,
Let’s drive all care a-way.

Why should the !rich de->>spise the poor?
Why should the !poor re-pine?
A >>lit-tle time will make us all
In >>e-qual >>friend-ship join.

The >>on-ly >>cir-cum->stance of !life
That >>ev-er I could find
To >>soft-en cares and >>tem-per strife
Was a con->>tent-ed mind;


When we’ve this in store,
We have much more
Than !wealth could e’er con-vey;
Then, since we have a >>sav-ior dear,
Let’s drive all care a-way.

When age, old >>creep-ing age comes on,
And we are !young no more,
Let’s all re->>pent the sins we’ve done,
Nor grieve that !youth is o’er;

We’ll more >>faith-ful be
Than for-mer-ly,
And >>con-stant-ly to pray;
Then, since we have a >>sav-ior dear,
Let’s !drive all care a-way.
